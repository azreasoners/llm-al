% constraints/rules

% 1. Moving a disk to a location causes the disk's location to become that location.
move(D,L) causes loc(D)=L.

% 2. A disk cannot be moved if there is another disk whose location is the disk being moved.
nonexecutable move(D,L) if loc(D2)=D.

% 3. The move action is not executable if the destination location is a disk and the disk being moved is heavier than the destination disk.
nonexecutable move(D,L) if L in disk & weight(D) > weight(L).

% 4. The move action is not executable if the disk being moved is the same as its destination location.
nonexecutable move(D,L) if D=L.

% 5. It is impossible for two disks to have the same location.
impossible loc(D1)=L & loc(D2)=L & D1\=D2.

% 6. It is impossible for a disk to be located on itself.
impossible loc(D)=D.
