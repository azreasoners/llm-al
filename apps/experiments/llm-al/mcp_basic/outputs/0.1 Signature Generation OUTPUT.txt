Actions:
- cross(Vessel) - Cross the river in the Vessel.

Constants:
- loc(Vessel) - The location of the Vessel, remains the same unless explicitly changed, so it is an inertial fluent.
- numOnBank(Location, Group) - The number of people of Group at a Location (bank), remains the same unless explicitly changed, so it is an inertial fluent.
- numCrossing(Vessel, Group) - The number of people of Group crossing in the Vessel during the crossing action, an attribute of `cross(Vessel)`.
