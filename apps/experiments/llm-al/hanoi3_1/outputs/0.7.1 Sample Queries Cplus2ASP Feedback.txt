% The query fails!

Each step is satisfiable up until 0, which has state/actions: "    0: loc(d1)=b & loc(d2)=d1 & loc(d3)=c & weight(d1)=3 & weight(d2)=2 & weight(d3)=1; and     0: move(d2,c);", which should be satisfiable but they are not.

The last satisfiable state, correponding to this query is:
:- query
        0: loc(d1)=b & loc(d2)=d1 & loc(d3)=c & weight(d1)=3 & weight(d2)=2 & weight(d3)=1;
        maxstep :: 0.

The actions and states are shown up until the last step in the query which is satisfiable. Consider why "    0: loc(d1)=b & loc(d2)=d1 & loc(d3)=c & weight(d1)=3 & weight(d2)=2 & weight(d3)=1; and     0: move(d2,c);" cannot be executed in step 0. Look at the last satisfiable state in the plan, and the rules which involve or may affect "    0: loc(d1)=b & loc(d2)=d1 & loc(d3)=c & weight(d1)=3 & weight(d2)=2 & weight(d3)=1; and     0: move(d2,c);", which would cause it to be nonexecutable (if it is an action) or cause something that leads to the query being unsatisfiable.
