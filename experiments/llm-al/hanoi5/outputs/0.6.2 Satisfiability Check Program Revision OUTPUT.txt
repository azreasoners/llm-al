% Generated constraints

% 1. Moving a disk causes the disk's location to become the target location.
move(D,L) causes loc(D)=L.

% 2. The move action is not executable if another disk is on top of the disk being moved.
nonexecutable move(D,L) if loc(D1)=D & D1 \= D.

% 3. The move action is not executable if there is already a disk at the target location.
nonexecutable move(D,L) if loc(D1)=L & D1 \= D.

% 4. The move action is not executable if the disk being moved is heavier than the disk at the target location when moving onto a disk.
nonexecutable move(D,L) if L=D1 & weight(D)>weight(D1).

% 5. A disk cannot be on itself.
impossible loc(D)=D.

% 6. Disks cannot be at the same location at the same time.
impossible loc(D1)=loc(D2) & D1 \= D2.

% 7. The weight of a disk remains the same unless explicitly changed.
% (No action changes the weight; inertia maintains it.)

% 8. The location of a disk remains the same unless changed by a move action.
% (Inertia of loc(disk) handles this.)

**Explanation and Revision:**

The error in the original program was due to an incorrect period `.` placed at the end of the constants section. In BC+, constant declarations should end with semicolons `;`, not periods. Additionally, there was a stray period `.` on a line by itself, which caused the syntax error.

Here is the corrected constants section:
