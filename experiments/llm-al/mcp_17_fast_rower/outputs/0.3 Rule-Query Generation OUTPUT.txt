% 1. Crossing in a vessel causes loc(vessel) to become toLocation(vessel).
cross(V) causes loc(V) = Loc if toLocation(V) = Loc.

% 2. Crossing in a vessel causes numAt(G, loc(vessel)) to decrease by numCrossing(vessel, G) for each group G.
cross(V) decrements numAt(G, Loc) by N if loc(V) = Loc & numCrossing(V, G) = N.

% 3. Crossing in a vessel causes numAt(G, toLocation(vessel)) to increase by numCrossing(vessel, G) for each group G.
cross(V) increments numAt(G, Loc) by N if toLocation(V) = Loc & numCrossing(V, G) = N.

% 4. The cross(vessel) action is not executable if the sum over all groups G of numCrossing(vessel, G) is zero.
nonexecutable cross(V) if N1 + N2 + N3 = 0 & numCrossing(V, missionaries) = N1 & numCrossing(V, strongMissionary) = N2 & numCrossing(V, cannibals) = N3.

% 5. The cross(vessel) action is not executable if the sum over all groups G of numCrossing(vessel, G) exceeds capacity(vessel).
nonexecutable cross(V) if N1 + N2 + N3 > C & numCrossing(V, missionaries) = N1 & numCrossing(V, strongMissionary) = N2 & numCrossing(V, cannibals) = N3 & capacity(V) = C.

% 6. The cross(vessel) action is not executable if numCrossing(vessel, G) is greater than numAt(G, loc(vessel)) for any group G.
nonexecutable cross(V) if N1 > N2 & numCrossing(V, G) = N1 & numAt(G, Loc) = N2 & loc(V) = Loc.

% 7. The capacity of the boat is two.
capacity(boat) = 2.

% 8. The number of people of any group at any location cannot be negative.
impossible numAt(G, Loc) < 0.

% 9. At any location Loc, if numAt(missionaries, Loc) plus numAt(strongMissionary, Loc) is greater than zero, then numAt(cannibals, Loc) cannot exceed numAt(missionaries, Loc) plus numAt(strongMissionary, Loc).
always ( numAt(missionaries, Loc) = N1 & numAt(strongMissionary, Loc) = N2 & numAt(cannibals, Loc) = N3 & N1 + N2 > 0 -> N3 <= N1 + N2 ).

% 10. The cross(vessel) action is not executable if numCrossing(vessel, cannibals) exceeds numCrossing(vessel, missionaries) plus numCrossing(vessel, strongMissionary), and numCrossing(vessel, strongMissionary) equals zero, when numCrossing(vessel, missionaries) plus numCrossing(vessel, strongMissionary) is greater than zero.
nonexecutable cross(V) if N1 + N2 > 0 & N3 > N1 + N2 & N2 = 0 & numCrossing(V, missionaries) = N1 & numCrossing(V, strongMissionary) = N2 & numCrossing(V, cannibals) = N3.
