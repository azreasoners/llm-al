% Crossing a vessel causes its loc(vessel) to change from its current location to the other bank.
% Crossing a vessel causes numAt(group, loc(vessel)) to decrease by transporting(vessel, group) for each group.
% Crossing a vessel causes numAt(group, the other bank) to increase by transporting(vessel, group) for each group.
% The action cross(vessel) is not executable if the sum of transporting(vessel, missionaries) and transporting(vessel, cannibals) is zero.
% The action cross(vessel) is not executable if the sum of transporting(vessel, group) exceeds capacity(vessel).
% The action cross(vessel) is not executable if transporting(vessel, group) exceeds numAt(group, loc(vessel)) for any group.
% The action cross(vessel) is not executable if transporting(vessel, group) is negative for any group.
% It is not allowed for numAt(cannibals, location) to exceed numAt(missionaries, location) at any location where numAt(missionaries, location) is greater than zero.
% It is not allowed for transporting(vessel, cannibals) to exceed transporting(vessel, missionaries) during the crossing when transporting(vessel, missionaries) is greater than zero.
% The action cross(vessel) is not executable if executing it would result in numAt(cannibals, location) exceeding numAt(missionaries, location) at any location where numAt(missionaries, location) is greater than zero.
% The action cross(vessel) is not executable if executing it would result in transporting(vessel, cannibals) exceeding transporting(vessel, missionaries) during crossing when transporting(vessel, missionaries) is greater than zero.
% The action cross(vessel) is not executable if no group members are being transported (the vessel is empty).
% The capacity of the vessel is 3.
% The numAt(group, location) remains the same unless group members are transported during crossing.
% The loc(vessel) remains the same unless it crosses.
% The numAt(group, location) is always between 0 and 6 inclusive for each group.
% The total number of missionaries and cannibals remains constant across both banks.
