% constraints/rules

% 1. The action cross(V) is not executable if the total number of people boarding exceeds the capacity of the vessel.
nonexecutable cross(V) if N1 + N2 > capacity(V) & amount(missionaries) = N1 & amount(cannibals) = N2.

% 2. The action cross(V) is not executable if the total number of people boarding the vessel is zero.
nonexecutable cross(V) if N1 + N2 = 0 & amount(missionaries) = N1 & amount(cannibals) = N2.

% 3. Crossing the boat causes the location of the boat to change to the other bank.
cross(boat) causes boatLocation=bank2 if boatLocation=bank1.
cross(boat) causes boatLocation=bank1 if boatLocation=bank2.

% 4. Crossing a vessel transfers amount(G) people from the current location to the other bank.
cross(V) decrements numAt(G,L) by N if boatLocation=L & amount(G)=N & V=boat.
cross(V) increments numAt(G,L2) by N if boatLocation=L & amount(G)=N & L2\=L & V=boat.
cross(bridge) decrements numAt(G,bank1) by N if amount(G)=N.
cross(bridge) increments numAt(G,bank2) by N if amount(G)=N.

% 5. The action cross(V) is not executable if the amount of any group boarding the vessel is negative or exceeds the number at the current location.
nonexecutable cross(V) if amount(G)=N & N < 0.
nonexecutable cross(V) if amount(G)=N & numAt(G,L)=N1 & N > N1 & ((V=boat & L=boatLocation) | (V=bridge & L=bank1)).

% 6. The action cross(V) is not executable if the cannibals on the vessel outnumber the missionaries on the vessel during crossing.
nonexecutable cross(V) if amount(cannibals)=N1 & amount(missionaries)=N2 & N2 > 0 & N1 > N2.

% 7. On either bank, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries unless there are no missionaries at that location.
impossible numAt(cannibals, L) > numAt(missionaries, L) & numAt(missionaries, L) > 0.

% 8. The capacity of the boat and the bridge is 2.
capacity(boat) = 2.
capacity(bridge) = 2.

% 9. The action cross(bridge) is not executable if no one is crossing.
nonexecutable cross(bridge) if N1 + N2 = 0 & amount(missionaries)=N1 & amount(cannibals)=N2.

% 10. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it.
% This is covered by rule 2.
