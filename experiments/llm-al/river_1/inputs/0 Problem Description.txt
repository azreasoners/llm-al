There is a mouse, a snake, and a piece of cheese, and you need to get them all across a river using a boat. However, you must ensure that the snake doesn't eat the mouse, and the mouse doesn't eat the cheese. As long as they are not left alone, then they cannot eat. The boat cannot carry more than one item.
