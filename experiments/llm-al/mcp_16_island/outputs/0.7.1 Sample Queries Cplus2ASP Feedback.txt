In your original program, the error occurs because you included the object `boat` directly as a parameter in the constants' declarations, specifically in `cross(boat) :: exogenousAction;`. In BC+, constants (such as actions and fluents) should be declared with parameters as **sorts**, not objects. 

To fix this error, you need to replace `boat` with the corresponding sort `vessel` in the constants declarations. This way, you can use variables of the sort `vessel` in your rules and refer to `boat` as an object of that sort when needed.

In the updated constants declarations, `cross(vessel)` is now correctly declared:


prolog
:- constants
    cross(vessel) :: exogenousAction;
    loc(vessel) :: inertialFluent(location);
    capacity(vessel) :: inertialFluent(integer);
    numM(place) :: additiveFluent(integer);
    numC(place) :: additiveFluent(integer);
    dest(vessel) :: attribute(location) of cross(vessel);
    numM_on(vessel) :: attribute(integer) of cross(vessel);
    numC_on(vessel) :: attribute(integer) of cross(vessel).
