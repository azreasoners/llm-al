Actions:
cross(boat) - Crossing the boat.

Constants:
loc(boat) - The location of the boat, which remains the same unless explicitly changed; an inertial fluent.
capacity(boat) - The capacity of the boat, which remains the same unless explicitly changed; an inertial fluent.
numMissionariesAt(location) - The number of missionaries at a location, which can change based on actions; an additive fluent.
numCannibalsAt(location) - The number of cannibals at a location, which can change based on actions; an additive fluent.
numOarsAt(location) - The number of oars at a location, which can change based on actions; an additive fluent.
numMissionariesOn(boat) - The number of missionaries on the boat during crossing; an attribute of cross(boat).
numCannibalsOn(boat) - The number of cannibals on the boat during crossing; an attribute of cross(boat).
numOarsOn(boat) - The number of oars on the boat during crossing; an attribute of cross(boat).
