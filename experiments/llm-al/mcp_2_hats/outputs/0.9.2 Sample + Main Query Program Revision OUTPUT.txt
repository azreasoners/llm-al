% Generated constraints

% 1. Crossing a vessel causes the vessel's location to change to the opposite bank.
cross(V) causes loc_vessel(V) = bank2 if loc_vessel(V) = bank1.
cross(V) causes loc_vessel(V) = bank1 if loc_vessel(V) = bank2.

% 2. Crossing a vessel causes the location of onboard members to change to the vessel's new location.
cross(V) causes loc_member(M) = NewLoc if onboard(V, M) & loc_vessel(V) = OldLoc & NewLoc \= OldLoc & (NewLoc = bank1 | NewLoc = bank2).

% 3. A member can be onboard the vessel only if they are at the same location as the vessel.
always (onboard(V, M) -> loc_member(M) = loc_vessel(V)).

% 4. Crossing a vessel is not executable if there are no members onboard.
nonexecutable cross(V) if 
    ~onboard(V, m1) & ~onboard(V, m2) & ~onboard(V, m3) &
    ~onboard(V, c1) & ~onboard(V, c2) & ~onboard(V, c3).

% 5. Crossing a vessel is not executable if more than two members are onboard.
nonexecutable cross(V) if onboard(V, M1) & onboard(V, M2) & onboard(V, M3) & M1 \= M2 & M1 \= M3 & M2 \= M3.

% 6. The cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on either bank unless there are no missionaries on that bank.

% For bank1:
impossible loc_member(Ms1)=bank1 & mission(Ms1) &
    ( (loc_member(Cs1)=bank1 & Cs1\=Ms1 & Cs1\=Cs2 & Cs1\=Cs3) &
      (loc_member(Cs2)=bank1 & Cs2\=Ms1 & Cs2\=Cs1 & Cs2\=Cs3) &
      (loc_member(Cs3)=bank1 & Cs3\=Ms1 & Cs3\=Cs1 & Cs3\=Cs2) ).

% Similarly for bank2:
impossible loc_member(Ms1)=bank2 & mission(Ms1) &
    ( (loc_member(Cs1)=bank2 & Cs1\=Ms1 & Cs1\=Cs2 & Cs1\=Cs3) &
      (loc_member(Cs2)=bank2 & Cs2\=Ms1 & Cs2\=Cs1 & Cs2\=Cs3) &
      (loc_member(Cs3)=bank2 & Cs3\=Ms1 & Cs3\=Cs1 & Cs3\=Cs2) ).

% Note: These rules need to cover all dangerous combinations where cannibals outnumber missionaries on a bank when missionaries are present.

% 7. The cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat unless there are no missionaries on the boat.

% Since the boat can carry at most two people, we need to consider when there's one missionary and one cannibal on board, which is acceptable.

% So, dangerous situation is only if there are two cannibals and one missionary on board, which is impossible due to boat capacity.

% 8. Exchanging hats between two members causes their hats to swap.
exchangeHat(M1, M2) causes hasHat(M1) = H2 if hasHat(M2) = H2.
exchangeHat(M1, M2) causes hasHat(M2) = H1 if hasHat(M1) = H1.

% 9. Exchanging hats is executable only if both members are at the same location.
nonexecutable exchangeHat(M1, M2) if loc_member(M1) \= loc_member(M2).

% 10. It is not executable to both cross a vessel and exchange hats at the same time.
nonexecutable cross(V) & exchangeHat(M1, M2).

% 11. It is not executable to exchange hats between a member and themselves.
nonexecutable exchangeHat(M1, M2) if M1 = M2.
