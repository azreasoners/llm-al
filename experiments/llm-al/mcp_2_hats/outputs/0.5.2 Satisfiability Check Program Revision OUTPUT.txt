% Generated constraints

% 1. Crossing a vessel causes the vessel's location to change to the opposite bank.
cross(V) causes loc_vessel(V) = bank2 if loc_vessel(V) = bank1.
cross(V) causes loc_vessel(V) = bank1 if loc_vessel(V) = bank2.

% 2. Crossing a vessel causes the location of onboard members to change to the vessel's new location.
cross(V) causes loc_member(M) = bank2 if onboard(V, M) & loc_vessel(V) = bank1.
cross(V) causes loc_member(M) = bank1 if onboard(V, M) & loc_vessel(V) = bank2.

% 3. Members not onboard remain at their current location after the crossing.
% (No action needed since loc_member(M) is an inertial fluent.)

% 4. A member can be onboard the vessel only if they are at the same location as the vessel.
always (onboard(V, M) -> loc_member(M) = loc_vessel(V)).

% 5. Crossing a vessel is not executable if there are no members onboard.
