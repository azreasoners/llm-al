% 1. Crossing the boat with two people causes the boat and the people to change to the other bank.
cross(P1, P2) causes loc(boat) = NewLoc & loc(P1) = NewLoc & loc(P2) = NewLoc if loc(boat) = Loc & NewLoc \= Loc.

% 2. The capacity of the boat is 2.
capacity(boat) = 2.

% 3. The action of crossing the boat is not executable unless P1 and P2 are at the same location as the boat.
nonexecutable cross(P1, P2) if loc(P1) \= loc(boat).
nonexecutable cross(P1, P2) if loc(P2) \= loc(boat).

% 4. It is impossible for a person to be at two different locations at the same time.
impossible loc(P) = Loc1 & loc(P) = Loc2 & Loc1 \= Loc2.
