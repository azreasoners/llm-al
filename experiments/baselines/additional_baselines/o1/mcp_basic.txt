There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2.

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

Thought about missionaries and cannibals puzzle for 1m 0s
Evaluating constraints

I’m examining the constraints of the puzzle, noting the cannibals' potential to outnumber missionaries on either bank or the boat if deprived of movement.

Clarifying boat constraints

The boat has a 2-person capacity, allowing combinations of 2 cannibals, 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal and 1 missionary, or 1 cannibal. 2 cannibals and 1 missionary is not feasible.

Strategizing the approach

I’m ensuring each boat crossing includes at least one person to maintain balance, avoiding more cannibals than missionaries. The boat can carry 1 missionary, 1 cannibal, or both.

Balancing the boat

I’ve concluded that the boat cannot carry more cannibals than missionaries, ensuring a safe crossing without compromising missionaries' safety.

Balancing boat dynamics

The boat cannot carry more cannibals than missionaries to ensure safety. Only 1 missionary or 1 cannibal per crossing is permissible.

Assessing configurations

The boat can carry 1 missionary or 1 cannibal, and with 2 missionaries, no cannibals are allowed. Valid configurations are 1 missionary, 2 missionaries, or 1 missionary and 1 cannibal.

Planning the route

Starting with 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals on bank1, the boat can carry 1M, 2M, or 1M 1C. Transferring 2 missionaries first is the initial step.

Transferring personnel

I’m weighing the options and concluded that sending 1 missionary and 1 cannibal to bank2 is the only choice that ensures the cannibals never outnumber the missionaries on either bank or the boat.

Returning the boat

I’m examining the possible returns, ensuring the boat's occupants match the valid configurations: 1 missionary, 2 missionaries, or 1 missionary and 1 cannibal. Returning 1 missionary is a viable option.

Returning the boat

After sending 1 missionary and 1 cannibal to bank2, I sent 1 missionary back. Now, bank1 has 3M and 2C, while bank2 has 0M and 1C, ensuring no outnumbering.

Mapping out scenario outcomes

I’m running through the rules and saw that cannibals outnumbering missionaries only matters if missionaries are present. Without any, this condition doesn't apply.

Reassessing the implications

Looks like no missionaries means cannibals outnumbering them isn't an issue. The constraints really hinge on the presence of missionaries. This observation seems crucial.

Assessing crossing strategies

Taking 1 missionary and 0 cannibals is a valid plan. This maintains equilibrium, ensuring never more cannibals than missionaries. Progressing to the next step now.

Setting up for the next move

I sent 1 missionary to bank2, confirming the state as 2M, 2C on bank1 and 1M, 1C on bank2. Now, I’ll figure out the next steps.

Mapping progress

Interestingly enough, after sending 1 missionary to bank2 and checking balance, I found that 1M alone or 1M and 1C return to bank1, making steady progress crucial.

Adjusting my strategy

I realized that sending 1M and 1C at once isn't valid since cannibals could outnumber missionaries on bank2. So, I opted for sending just 1 missionary instead.

Weighing options

I tried sending 1M and 1C back to bank1, but it just took us back to the initial state and didn't make any progress.

Reassessing puzzle constraints

I’m gathering info on the puzzle's constraint that the boat can never hold more cannibals than missionaries. Transporting more than one cannibal to bank2 seems impossible.

Mapping out progress

I sent 1 missionary and 1 cannibal to bank2, ensuring balance on both banks. Now, I’m figuring out the next moves to keep everyone safe.

Taking a closer look

I’m ensuring every boat configuration adheres to the rule of not having more cannibals than missionaries, aiming for valid states with balanced numbers on both banks. Progress is steady.

Reevaluating the solution

I’m thinking through the constraint that the boat can't carry more cannibals than missionaries. Initially, 1M and 1C don't work, but I progress by sending 1M several times, balancing both banks.

Tackling constraints

I’m systematically examining the puzzle with the constraint that cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries on the boat or either bank, to see if it’s solvable.

Evaluating valid moves

I’m mapping out valid first moves: 1M, 2M, or 1M1C. Each move ensures cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either bank. Progressing methodically.

Ensuring balance

I’m validating each boat movement to make sure cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either bank. It’s interesting to see the logic unfold step-by-step.

Ensuring progress

Examining boat capacity and valid combinations, I’m ensuring cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either bank. The valid combination for the next move is 1M.

Summarizing the steps

I’m moving 1M back to bank1, ensuring valid states with balanced numbers of missionaries and cannibals on both banks. Progressing to the next step helps maintain equilibrium.

Evaluating puzzle constraints

I’m considering if the puzzle is solvable with the restriction that the boat can't carry more cannibals than missionaries. Typically, the boat isn't subject to this constraint.

Below is an explanation of why, under the stated rules, there is no solution to get all 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals from bank1 to bank2. In particular, the extra rule

“The cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat…”
makes the usual solution impossible.

1. Restating the Problem and the Extra Constraint
We have:

3 missionaries (M) and 3 cannibals (C) on bank1 initially.
A boat on bank1, which can carry 1 or 2 people at a time.
Goal: move all 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals to bank2.
Usual constraint: on either bank, cannibals must never outnumber missionaries (if there are any missionaries there).
New extra constraint: on the boat itself, cannibals must never outnumber missionaries at any time.
Effect of the Extra Constraint on Boat Configurations
Because the boat can hold at most 2 people, the only ways to not have “C outnumber M on the boat” are:

1 missionary (and 0 cannibals)
2 missionaries (and 0 cannibals)
1 missionary + 1 cannibal
Any boat load with more cannibals than missionaries (such as 1 cannibal alone or 2 cannibals alone) is forbidden by the new rule.

Hence the only possible boat-loads at any crossing or return trip are:

(1M) by itself
(2M)
(1M,1C)
2. Checking All Possible First Moves
Initially, all 3M and 3C are on bank1. Let’s see which first move(s) are even legal.

(1M) crossing alone?
Leaves bank1 with (2M, 3C). That side has 3 cannibals vs 2 missionaries. 
3
>
2
3>2 → missionaries are outnumbered on bank1. Not allowed.

(2M) crossing together?
Leaves bank1 with (1M, 3C). That side has 3 cannibals vs 1 missionary. 
3
>
1
3>1 → outnumbered on bank1. Not allowed.

(1M,1C) crossing together?
Leaves bank1 with (2M, 2C). That side has 2 cannibals vs 2 missionaries (
2
≤
2
2≤2), which is okay. On the boat: (1M,1C), which is okay because 
1
=
1
1=1. Arriving on bank2: (1M,1C), which is also okay since 
1
≥
1
1≥1.
This is the only valid first move.

Thus the only possible first trip is

yaml
Copy
Edit
Cross #1:
   Bank1 -> Bank2: (1M,1C)
   New state:
      Bank1: (2M,2C)
      Bank2: (1M,1C)
      Boat on Bank2
3. Next: Someone Must Return
Now the boat is on bank2 with (1M,1C). Possible return trips (Bank2 -> Bank1) must also obey the “no outnumbering on the boat” rule, so again the return-boat load can only be:

(1M) alone, or
(1M,1C) together
(We cannot send back 1C alone, because then on the boat we’d have 1 cannibal and 0 missionaries, which is forbidden.)

Case 3.1: Return (1M) Alone
That would give:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Cross #2 (return):
   Bank2 -> Bank1: (1M)
   New state:
      Bank1: (3M,2C)
      Bank2: (0M,1C)
      Boat on Bank1
Is this state legal?

Bank1 has (3M,2C) → 2C ≤ 3M, so that’s fine.
Bank2 has (0M,1C) → If there are 0 missionaries on a bank, that is also okay (nobody is there to be outnumbered/eaten).
The boat is back on Bank1.
So this return trip is valid. Let’s proceed from there.

4. Next Crossing from Bank1 to Bank2 Again
Now Bank1 = (3M,2C), Bank2 = (0M,1C), boat on Bank1. The boat can only carry:

(1M)
(2M)
(1M,1C)
We check each possibility:

(1M) from Bank1 to Bank2?

Leaving behind (2M,2C) on Bank1: that’s okay (
2
≥
2
2≥2).
Arriving on Bank2: it already had (0M,1C), so it becomes (1M,1C). That’s okay (
1
≥
1
1≥1).
So this move is valid.
(2M) from Bank1 to Bank2?

That would leave (1M,2C) on Bank1. Then 
2
𝐶
>
1
𝑀
2C>1M, not allowed.
So (2M) is impossible here.
(1M,1C) from Bank1 to Bank2?

That would leave (2M,1C) on Bank1 (
1
≤
2
1≤2), which is fine.
But arriving on Bank2 would yield (1M+1M, 1C+1C) = (2M,2C)? Actually, no:
Currently Bank2 has (0M,1C).
Add (1M,1C) → new Bank2 has (1M,2C).
(1M,2C) has 2C > 1M → not allowed.
So (1M,1C) is impossible here.
Hence from the state (Bank1: 3M,2C; Bank2: 0M,1C), the only forward move is taking (1M) across:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Cross #3:
   Bank1 -> Bank2: (1M)
   New state:
      Bank1: (2M,2C)
      Bank2: (1M,1C)
      Boat on Bank2
5. Next: Someone Must Return from Bank2 to Bank1
Now Bank2 has (1M,1C). Possible return loads (still obeying the boat rule) are:

(1M) alone
(1M,1C) together
But observe:

If (1M) returns, the resulting state is

makefile
Copy
Edit
Bank1: (3M,2C)
Bank2: (0M,1C)
which is exactly where we were after Cross #2. We have made no net progress; we are in a loop.

If (1M,1C) return, that undoes our original first crossing completely, putting us back at the very start:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Bank1: (3M,3C)
Bank2: (0M,0C)
which is the initial state. Again, no net progress.

Thus, every possible return trip from Bank2 at this point either cycles us back to a previous state or resets the puzzle entirely.

In other words, once you make the only legal first crossing 
(
1
𝑀
,
1
𝐶
)
(1M,1C), you get stuck in a back-and-forth cycle.

6. Conclusion: No Sequence Can Succeed
Because of the added condition that “cannibals may never outnumber missionaries on the boat,” you are never allowed to send a cannibal alone, nor send two cannibals together. In the classic version of the puzzle (without the boat-outnumbering restriction), one typically needs to ferry two cannibals across, or one cannibal back, etc., to make progress.

Under these stricter rules, every path gets stuck. You can verify systematically that no other branching of moves will ever allow all 3M and 3C to end up safely on the far side without violating the “cannibals ≤ missionaries” rule on some bank or on the boat.

Hence:

No solution exists under the rule that the boat itself can never have more cannibals than missionaries.
7. What If the Boat Constraint Were Removed?
For reference, the classic Missionaries-and-Cannibals puzzle does have a known solution if you only forbid outnumbering on the banks (and not on the boat). One standard solution sequence in the classic puzzle is:

(
1
𝑀
,
1
𝐶
)
(1M,1C) cross → 
(

(3M,0C) left, 
(

(0M,3C) right
(

(3M,1C) left, 
(

(0M,2C) right
(

(2M) cross →

(1M,1C) left, 
(

(2M,2C) right
(

(1M,1C) return → 
(

)
(2M,2C) left, 
(

2

)
(1M,2C) right
(
2
𝑀
)
(2M) cross → 
(
0
𝑀
,
2
𝐶
)
(0M,2C) left, 
(
3
𝑀
,
2
𝐶
)
(3M,2C) right
(
1
𝐶
)
(1C) return → 
(
0
𝑀
,
3
𝐶
)
(0M,3C) left, 
(
3
𝑀
,
1
𝐶
)
(3M,1C) right
(
2
𝐶
)
(2C) cross → 
(
0
𝑀
,
1
𝐶
)
(0M,1C) left, 
(
3
𝑀
,
3
𝐶
)
(3M,3C) right
But that sequence crucially uses the boat-loads 
(
2
𝐶
)
(2C), 
(
1
𝐶
)
(1C) alone, etc., which are forbidden once you require “no outnumbering on the boat.”

Thus, the extra boat rule is precisely what makes the puzzle impossible to solve.
