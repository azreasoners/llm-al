There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Four missionaries and four cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. However, there is one strong missionary which can row fast. As long as the strong missionary rows, then the cannibals won't become so hungry that they will eat the missionaries. 

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Four missionaries and four cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

Thought about missionaries and cannibals puzzle for 1m 6s
Reconsidering the equation
OK, let's see. With a powerful rower on the boat, cannibals don't attack missionaries, which means their numerical balance isn't crucial for transit.

Crafting a tailored fit
I'm thinking through how M1's rowing might reduce crossings. Considering combinations of M1 and cannibals, I aim to simplify the process while avoiding cannibals' survival attempts.

Confirming constraints
Mapping out the rules, if the strong missionary M1 is in the boat, up to two cannibals can travel without risking their lives since M1 ensures their safety and comfort.

Ferrying cannibals efficiently
I'm piecing together a plan to safely transport cannibals using the strong missionary, ferrying them back in pairs to avoid overpowering missionaries on either bank.

Mapping the journey
Starting with a 2-person boat and strong missionary, ferry 1 cannibal at a time. Ensuring the boat never overloads with cannibals compared to missionaries.

Ensuring parity
Second trip confirmed the boat's safety, keeping more missionaries than cannibals on both banks without any discrepancy. Progress is being made with each crossing.

Ensuring balance
Considering the trip's aftermath, 3 missionaries and 2 cannibals on the left bank, and 1 strong missionary and 2 cannibals on the right bank. This setup avoids any imbalances.

Revisiting the puzzle's rules
While it seems safe for the strong missionary to stay with the 2 cannibals, the bank can't have 1 missionary outnumbered by 2 cannibals for safety.

Balancing constraints
Ensuring safety, let's think it over: with the strong missionary aboard, up to 2 cannibals can cross at a time, keeping the boat balanced and mitigating any risks.

Crafting a plan
Balancing 4 missionaries and 4 cannibals, a standard method has emerged, transporting 2 cannibals each trip, ensuring proportional trips for safety on both banks.

Navigating options
Taking a closer look, using the strong missionary to manage the ferrying process, ensures safety by finalizing all cannibals on the right side and leaving 3 missionaries on the left.

Navigating uncertainties
OK, so with the strong missionary, keeping 1 of 4 cannibals on the right side is safe. Now, let's plan how to get the boat back without leaving anyone behind.

Balancing the equation
The approach to ferrying cannibals and the strong missionary ensures the boat is always balanced, with cannibals never outnumbering missionaries. Progress is steady and methodical.

Mapping ferry trips
Taking 3 cannibals, ferrying them with the strong missionary, and keeping the boat balanced. Cannibals never outnumber missionaries, ensuring steady progress.

Ensuring safe passage
We transport missionaries and cannibals iteratively, ensuring they never outnumber each other on either bank, leveraging the strong missionary's presence for security.

Ensuring safety
OK, so leaving a lone normal missionary with cannibals isn't safe. A better move is to send a cannibal back to balance the boat's safety.

Ensuring balance
OK, let me see. Initially, I planned to ferry the strong missionary with the cannibals. But the updated plan balances the boat on each side, keeping safety intact.

Revisiting the strategy
It's becoming clear that without the strong missionary, a single missionary can't handle multiple cannibals. Rearranging the strategy ensures everyone's safety.

Mapping the journey
Let's carefully balance the boat's safety. Using the strong missionary's speed, we systematically ferry individuals, ensuring no cannibals ever outnumber missionaries on either side.

Tracing the journey
Balancing the boat's safety is key. Iterative ferrying with the strong missionary ensures no cannibals outnumber missionaries on either side, safeguarding everyone effectively.

Clarifying the ambiguity
The puzzle's unclear whether the strong missionary alone can prevent cannibals from attacking missionaries, suggesting their presence on the boat or bank overrides the usual outnumbering rule.

Clarifying safe conditions
OK, let me see. The puzzle suggests the strong missionary alone can tackle cannibals. Without him, the trick follows the usual rule: cannibals can't outnumber missionaries.

Taking a closer look

I'm considering various methods to balance ferrying missionaries and cannibals, including taking a pair of missionaries or cannibals each time, while ensuring the boat always remains balanced.

Mapping the route
I'm ferrying 2 cannibals at a time, using the strong missionary's speed to ensure the boat balance and keep safety on both banks intact.

Safeguarding the crossing
Taking multiple steps to ensure equilibrium, such as balancing cannibals with the strong missionary on each side, guarantees that no one is ever outnumbered or left vulnerable.

Ensuring safety
Mapping out a plan to ferry all cannibals and missionaries, I ensure they never outnumber each other on either side, especially without the strong missionary.

Ensuring equilibrium
Taking a closer look, ferrying both cannibals at once with the strong missionary ensures no outnumbering by either side, keeping the boat balanced and everyone safe.

Mapping the journey
I'm ferrying missionaries and cannibals with the strong missionary, ensuring no outnumbering on either side by making careful trips to keep the boat balanced.

Taking a closer look
Now I’m ensuring a balance by ferrying missionaries and cannibals with the strong missionary, making sure no outnumbering on either side by keeping the boat balanced.

Evaluating safety
It’s interesting to see that the left side has 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal, while on the right side, there are 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals, all balanced and safe.

Ensuring equilibrium
Alternating ferrying times and revisiting the left shows a clear pattern: missionaries and cannibals never outnumber each other, maintaining balanced and safe progress throughout the journey.

Pulling together a practical plan
Noticing the strong missionary's impact, alternating ferrying with the strong missionary ensures balanced progress. Safety on both banks is achieved through collaborative effort and balanced movement.

Charting the course
Organizing ferrying steps with the strong missionary ensures balanced trips and minimizes safety risks for all missionaries and cannibals, posing an engaging logistical challenge.

Below is one explicit, step‐by‐step solution that works under the usual “missionaries & cannibals” rules plus the special rule about the strong missionary (“M1”) preventing cannibals from eating missionaries if and only if he is present on the same side/boat. In other words:

On either bank, cannibals may never outnumber missionaries unless the strong missionary 
𝑀
1
M1 is there to protect them.
On the boat, cannibals may never outnumber missionaries unless 
𝑀
1
M1 is on the boat.
The boat can carry at most two people and cannot move empty.

All eight are safely on the Right.
Verifying Safety
At each step:

If a bank has no missionaries, there is no danger there (cannibals cannot outnumber “zero”).
If a bank has missionaries and cannibals, we check that either (a) missionaries are not outnumbered, i.e.\ 
#
𝑀
≥
#
𝐶
#M≥#C, or (b) the strong missionary 
𝑀
1
M 
1
​
  is present on that bank (which keeps it safe even if outnumbered).
On the boat, any crossing that has more cannibals than missionaries also includes 
𝑀
1
M 
1
​
 , making it safe.
Following these rules, the sequence above never leaves a “normal” missionary outnumbered by cannibals without 
𝑀
1
M 
1
​
  present. Hence it achieves the goal:

All 4 missionaries and all 4 cannibals move from bank1 (L) to bank2 (R) safely.
All 4 missionaries and all 4 cannibals move from bank1 (L) to bank2 (R) safely.
