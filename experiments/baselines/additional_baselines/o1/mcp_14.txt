There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. The river leaks if there are two people inside of it, in which case water needs to be bailed while crossing. A single person cannot row and bail simultaneously.

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

Thought about missionaries and cannibals puzzle for 1m 5s
Tweaking the classic puzzle

It's interesting to see how the classic Missionaries & Cannibals puzzle is adjusted with a boat leakage issue, creating a new challenge by adding fuel management and limiting boat occupancy to two.

Understanding constraints

I'm noticing that the boat leaks only when two people are aboard, requiring one to bail water while the other rows. Solo travel won't be possible because of this leakage.

Navigating the crossing

OK, let me see. If only one person is in the boat, crossing alone is possible without bailing, since the river leaks only when two people are aboard.

Balancing constraints

OK, I’m considering the boat's capacity and the guidelines for cannibals and missionaries. If one person is on the boat, crossing is feasible without evaporating any constraints.

Mapping out the solution

OK, let me see. The standard solution focuses on handling 2 cannibals without missionaries on the boat, keeping things safe and meeting all constraints.

Tracking the journey

I'm mapping out the ferry trip by documenting each crossing and return, ensuring missionaries and cannibals stay balanced on both sides throughout the trip to avoid any dangerous imbalances.

Charting the course

OK, let me see. I’m considering the solution for the classic puzzle with the added constraint of managing a leaky boat, ensuring missionaries and cannibals stay balanced on both sides throughout.

Charting the journey

OK, let me see. Ensuring boats cross without exceeding the cannibal count, I’ll list each crossing, maintain balance between rigor and flexibility, and test for solid logic flow.

Pondering the journey

Charting each step to balance missionaries and cannibals on both banks, safeguarding constraints, and considering the leaky boat scenario with a thorough method to ensure optimal progress.

Crafting the strategy

Seeking an optimal solution to balance missionaries and cannibals, ensuring the boat can handle at most two passengers, and addressing the leaky boat challenge.

Piecing together the plan

OK, I’m mapping out the steps to balance missionaries and cannibals, ensuring the boat's capacity is never exceeded, and preventing any dangerous imbalances.

Working through the puzzle

I’m thinking through the rules: ensuring cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either side of the boat. This means the classic solution might need some tweaking.

Implementing step-by-step

Starting with two missionaries crossing, I’ll ensure the boat's constraints and avoid missionaries getting outnumbered by cannibals on either side.

Taking a closer look

I’m analyzing each step to ensure the boat's constraints are met and missionaries aren't outnumbered by cannibals on either side. Trying a new sequence to find a valid solution.

Testing new strategies

I’m working through different crossing sequences to balance the number of missionaries and cannibals on each side, ensuring safety and adhering to the puzzle's constraints.

Ensuring constraints

I’m working through this by making sure the boat's movements keep both missionaries and cannibals balanced, and no group outnumbers the other on either side throughout the journey.

Ensuring a safe crossing

I’m mapping out the final steps to balance missionaries and cannibals, confirming no boat capacity violations and maintaining safety by observing the same count of each group throughout the journey.

Confirming valid scenarios

I’m mapping out the boat's capacity constraints and ensuring the boat never has 1 missionary and 2 cannibals, 1 missionary and 1 cannibal together, or exceeds its capacity of 2.

Validating the approach

I’m checking each step of the solution to balance missionaries and cannibals on both banks, ensuring safety and adherence to constraints throughout the crossing.

Below is one explicit solution (one of several) that satisfies all of the constraints:

The boat can carry at most 2 people.
The boat cannot move empty.
On either bank, cannibals 
𝐶
C never outnumber missionaries 
𝑀
M (if there is at least one 
𝑀
M present).
On the boat itself, cannibals never outnumber missionaries (if there is at least one 
𝑀
M on board).
If there are 2 people in the boat, one must bail and the other must row (which is allowed as long as there are indeed 2 people).
A single person in the boat simply rows without needing to bail (the leak happens only with 2 aboard).
We label the banks as:

bank1 = Left Bank
bank2 = Right Bank
and the initial state is:

Left Bank: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Right Bank: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Boat: on the Left Bank (bank1)
We want all 3 missionaries and all 3 cannibals to end up safely on bank2.

Notation
We write a “move” in the form 
(
#
𝑀
,
#
𝐶
)
(#M,#C) to mean “
#
𝑀
#M missionaries and 
#
𝐶
#C cannibals cross in the boat from the current bank of the boat to the opposite bank.”
After each crossing, we will list how many 
𝑀
M and 
𝐶
C are on the Left Bank and on the Right Bank, and also note where the boat ends up.
The Step-by-Step Plan
Starting State:

Right side has 0M, 2C

Now we have effectively swapped sides: all cannibals on the Left, all missionaries on the Right.

All 3 missionaries and all 3 cannibals are now safely on bank2.

Verifying the “No-One-Gets-Eaten” Constraints
No side is ever outnumbered:

At each intermediate step, whenever there are missionaries present on a bank, the number of cannibals on that bank is never larger.
We also have times when a bank has zero missionaries; that is automatically safe (cannibals can’t eat missionaries who aren’t there).
No outnumbering on the boat:

Whenever the boat has two people, they are either 
(
2
𝑀
,
0
𝐶
)
(2M,0C), or 
(
0
𝑀
,
2
𝐶
)
(0M,2C), or 
(
1
𝑀
,
1
𝐶
)
(1M,1C).
In all those cases, missionaries are not outnumbered aboard.
Rowing/Bailing constraint:

When there are 2 passengers, one can row and one can bail.
When there is 1 passenger, that person just rows (no leaking problem with a single passenger).
Hence, this 11-crossing sequence is a valid plan under all of the stated rules.
