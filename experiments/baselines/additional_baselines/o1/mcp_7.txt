There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. Missionaries cannot row.

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

Thought about missionaries and cannibals puzzle for 44 seconds
Here’s the challenge

Three missionaries and three cannibals need to cross a river with a boat that carries at most two people, avoiding having more cannibals than missionaries on either side.

Revisiting constraints

I’m thinking through the rule that cannibals must never outnumber missionaries on the boat or they will be eaten, and the boat must carry at least one cannibal.

Charting the course

I’m laying out the initial and target states with three missionaries and three cannibals. The plan involves two cannibals crossing first, ensuring the boat is rowed by cannibals.

Returning the boat

A cannibal returns with the boat to bank1, ensuring missionaries aren't outnumbered and maintaining the boat's requirement to stay rowed by cannibals.

Adjusting my approach

I’m piecing together that keeping a cannibal behind is crucial to ferry missionaries, and the boat should contain at least one cannibal to ensure safe passage.

Testing the waters

I’m thinking through a sequence where two cannibals cross first, but this leaves three cannibals stranded on the other side. I’m rethinking this approach to find a viable solution.

Mapping the sequence

I’m organizing the crossing sequence, ensuring each step maintains valid distribution rules. Progress is steady as I work through potential sequences.

Evaluating strategies

I’m assessing valid boat configurations and ensuring even distribution of missionaries and cannibals. Progress is being made towards a solution that fits the constraints.

Charting the journey

I’ve identified three initial crossing options: one cannibal, two cannibals, or one cannibal with one missionary. Validity is confirmed by ensuring no bank is outnumbered. Progress is steady.

Revisiting strategies

I’m rethinking valid boat return strategies, ensuring no bank is outnumbered and all constraints are satisfied. The goal is to maintain progress towards a viable solution.

Ensuring balance

I’m carefully checking the bank configurations to avoid leaving missionaries alone with cannibals or creating more cannibals inadvertently. Progressing through each step meticulously, I confirm valid arrangements.

Ensuring stability

It's crucial to prevent scenarios where cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank or boat. This highlights the need for precise coordination and monitoring.

Evaluating tactics

Examining four potential return strategies, I find three invalid due to constraints or reset conditions. Focusing on additional initial moves to progress the solution.

Evaluating stability

I'm checking which boat configurations keep missionaries and cannibals evenly balanced on both banks. Progress is steady, ensuring no bank outnumbers the other without missionaries present.

Transferring cannibals

I’m organizing the crossing sequence to balance cannibals and missionaries on each bank. Each step is carefully checked to ensure even distribution and valid configurations.

Evaluating options

I’m considering the return of a single cannibal, ensuring the banks remain balanced and adhering to constraints. This move helps in consistently tracking progress towards achieving a valid solution.

Reassessing approach

I’m rethinking the return of any individuals to ensure balanced banks, avoiding outnumbering constraints. This careful adjustment helps progress towards a solution by maintaining distribution stability.

Evaluating failure points

Interestingly enough, paths with two cannibals are dead ends, leading to outnumbered banks or stuck boats. This reinforces the argument that the puzzle might indeed be unsolvable.

Confirming unsolvability

Interestingly, the puzzle is unsolvable with three missionaries and three cannibals if only cannibals can row. Having only cannibals rowing leads to scenarios where the boat is stuck or banks are outnumbered.

Confirming the unsolvability

Given the constraints, it is clear that there is no feasible plan to safely transfer all missionaries and cannibals across the river without violating the rules.

Below is a fairly short explanation why no solution exists under these rules, followed by a more systematic look at all possible first moves and why each path eventually fails.

Key Constraints
Boat capacity: 1 or 2 people.
Boat cannot be empty when crossing.
No side (bank) can have more cannibals than missionaries when there is at least one missionary present there.
No boat configuration can have more cannibals than missionaries if at least one missionary is in the boat.
Missionaries cannot row.
This implies at least one cannibal must be on the boat whenever it crosses, since someone has to row.
Because missionaries cannot row, the possible boat-loads on any crossing are limited to:

1 cannibal (C),
2 cannibals (C,C),
1 missionary + 1 cannibal (M,C).
(Boat-loads like 2 missionaries, or 1 missionary alone, are impossible because no one would be able to row.)

Why the Puzzle Is Unsolvable
Intuitively, the crux of the problem is that you eventually need cannibals on both banks at the right times to shuttle missionaries across. But whenever you try to leave a cannibal or two on the far bank and bring the boat back, you wind up violating the “no outnumbering” rule on one side or the other—or you end up stranding all cannibals on the far bank with no way to bring the boat back (since missionaries cannot row).

A quick way to see the impossibility is:

You might try sending cannibals over first (so that some cannibal is on Bank2 to row back for missionaries).
But if you send too many cannibals over, they can no longer come back to fetch missionaries without leaving Bank1 outnumbered (or returning empty, which is forbidden).
If you send too few cannibals, you never get enough on Bank2 to bring the boat back effectively.
Meanwhile, any time you add a missionary to the boat, you must also have a cannibal there (to row), which risks outnumbering somewhere.
Systematically, one finds every path eventually leads to a dead end. Let us illustrate by checking all the plausible first moves from the initial state.

Initial State
(

,
3
;
  
0
,
0
;
  
boat at Bank1
)
.
(3,3;0,0;boat at Bank1).
Since missionaries cannot row, the boat crossing from Bank1 to Bank2 must include at least one cannibal:

(1) Send 1 cannibal

After crossing:
(
3
,
2
;
  
0
,
1
;
  
boat at Bank2
)
.
(3,2;0,1;boat at Bank2).
Bank1 is stable 
(
3
≥
2
)
(3≥2). Bank2 has no missionaries, so no issue there.
But now on Bank2 we have 1 cannibal alone.
If that cannibal comes back, we are at the original state.
If it stays, we cannot move the boat at all (it is on Bank2, but we have no second person to bring back, and we cannot cross empty).
This path goes nowhere.
(2) Send 2 cannibals

After crossing:
(
3
,
1
;
  
0
,
2
;
  
boat at Bank2
)
.
(3,1;0,2;boat at Bank2).
Stable so far. Next, someone must row back to Bank1 (since the boat cannot sit idle if we hope to transport missionaries).
The only possibilities are:
(a) 1 cannibal returns,
(b) 2 cannibals return.
If 2 cannibals return, we reset to the start. If 1 cannibal returns, we get:
(
3
,
2
;
  
0
,
1
;
  
boat at Bank1
)
.
(3,2;0,1;boat at Bank1).
From there, any next crossing from Bank1 to Bank2 must again have at least one cannibal. The plausible loads are:
(i) 2 cannibals 
→
→ leads to 
(
3
,
0
;
  
0
,
3
)
(3,0;0,3). Then no cannibal is left on Bank1 to bring the boat back for the missionaries. Dead end.
(ii) 1 cannibal 
→
→ that just toggles between the same states or strands all cannibals on Bank2 eventually.
(iii) 1 missionary + 1 cannibal 
→
→ inevitably causes outnumbering on one bank or the other.
Checking each sub-branch quickly runs into a violation or a stalemate.
(3) Send 1 missionary + 1 cannibal

After crossing:
(
2
,
2
;
  
1
,
1
;
  
boat at Bank2
)
.
(2,2;1,1;boat at Bank2).
Banks are still stable: on Bank1, we have 
3
𝑀
≥
3
𝐶
3M≥3C at the start, and now 
(
2
,
2
)
(2,2) is stable; on Bank2, 
(
1
,
1
)
(1,1) is also stable.
The next move must be a crossing back to Bank1, but the only rowers are cannibals. So we look at possible returns:
(a) 1 cannibal returns 
→
→ would leave Bank2 with 
(
1
,
0
)
(1,0) and Bank1 with 
(
2
,
3
)
(2,3). But 
2
𝑀
<
3
𝐶
2M<3C on Bank1 is not stable.
(b) 1 missionary returns 
→
→ cannot happen (missionary can’t row).
(c) 1 missionary + 1 cannibal return 
→
→ that just resets the state to the beginning.
(d) 2 cannibals return 
→
→ impossible because Bank2 only has 1 cannibal at the moment.
Hence no legal next step.
Because all three of these first-move choices lead to a dead end (or back to the start), the puzzle cannot progress.

Conclusion
Under the constraint that missionaries cannot row, there is no way to ferry all three missionaries and three cannibals across without violating the “outnumbering” rule on some crossing or on one of the banks.

Answer: There is no solution (no valid sequence of crossings) that satisfies all the given rules.
