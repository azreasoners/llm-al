There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a rowboat which carries at most two people at once. The rowboat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the rowboat or the missionaries will be eaten. The rowboat's capacity is 2.

rowboat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The rowboat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

Thought about missionaries and cannibals puzzle for 2m 3s
Crafting a strategy

I’m mapping out a plan to navigate the 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals puzzle, ensuring safe crossings and minimal trips, emphasizing safety and collaboration.

Charting the course

I'm working through ensuring no side or boat is overrun by examining each move's constraints and safety. This leads to considering optimal solutions that balance safety and efficiency.

Implementing the strategy

I’m assessing a well-established solution to ensure missionaries and cannibals are safely transported without being outnumbered on any side or boat. This approach ensures a systematic and secure transfer.

Ensuring safe transport

I'm noting the importance of monitoring the boat's capacity and occupants to ensure missionaries are never outnumbered by cannibals, preventing any unsafe shifts in the puzzle.

Unpacking the rules

I’m analyzing the ambiguity of the puzzle's constraints on who can be in the boat together, ensuring that the boat's capacity and occupants are always balanced and feasible.

Ensuring fair balance

I’m thinking through the puzzle's rule that the boat is a valid location for balanced scenarios, ensuring the cannibals never outnumber the missionaries, by strictly adhering to the wording and constraints.

Ensuring balance

I’m working through the puzzle's constraints, noting the boat can never carry 2 cannibals with any number of missionaries, as this would violate the rule of missionaries not being outnumbered.

Charting a safe passage

I’m outlining valid boat compositions and enumerating potential ferry routes, ensuring missionaries never outnumbered by cannibals, thus guaranteeing their safe crossing to the other side.

Adjusting my strategy

I’m tweaking the plan to avoid cannibals outnumbering missionaries. Progressing through ferry trips, I’m ensuring safe transport by re-evaluating each move to maintain balance.

Piecing it together

I’m testing various boat combinations to ensure missionaries and cannibals are balanced. Each move must avoid outnumbering, employing a systematic approach to find the safest solution.

Ensuring safety

I’m carefully verifying that no single cannibal is in the boat alone with missionaries, as this would result in outnumbering, ensuring maximal compliance with the puzzle's constraints.

Remaining compliant

I'm noting that the boat must travel with a missionary or missionaries to ensure safety. Cannibals cannot be left alone to avoid outnumbering, stringent rules dictate their movements.

Ensuring safety

I’m examining various moves to maintain missionary safety. The valid starting move involves transporting one missionary and one cannibal, ensuring no one is outnumbered on either side.

Transferring and adjusting

I’m pulling a missionary back to the left bank alone. This keeps balance, ensuring no bank has more cannibals than missionaries, allowing us to continue safely.

Transferring and adjusting

I’m working on ferrying a missionary alone to the right bank, ensuring safety. This move is valid, maintaining balance and keeping missionaries and cannibals evenly distributed across all sides.

Navigating the challenge

Returning a missionary to the left bank only reshuffles the starting conditions. This symmetrical pattern suggests that the iterative approach might need tweaking for progress.

Ensuring valid moves

I'm piecing together that returning with (M) alone or (M, C) keeps the boat balanced. This leads me to think through the safest ferrying options to prevent outnumbering.

Assessing potential moves

I’m examining the final ferrying steps and considering different sequences. Each move must ensure the boat is balanced, and no location is outnumbered, to maintain safety throughout the solution.

Navigating constraints

I’m noting the challenge of maintaining balance with the constraints, as each move either outnumbers missionaries or cannibals or causes a loop, making progress challenging.

Mapping potential solutions

I’m assessing all valid boat trips and determining the only feasible start is ferrying one missionary and one cannibal, as other moves lead to outnumbering or unproductive loops.

Evaluating movement

I'm observing the limited valid moves and ensuring they maintain balance by avoiding outnumbering. This involves ferrying missionaries or cannibals from left to right or vice versa.

Reassessing strategy

OK, let me see. I’m re-evaluating each valid move to ensure optimal progress. The current path seems to be in a loop, so I need to restructure the approach for a solution.

Piecing it together

I'm concluding that with the given rules, the puzzle cannot be solved because the constraints prevent any valid sequence of moves without outnumbering a group on either side of the boat.

Seeking a way

I'm figuring out if a solution exists for the puzzle with the extra constraint that cannibals can't outnumber missionaries on the boat itself, making it unsolvable with the given conditions.

Examining puzzle constraints

I’m working through the puzzling constraint about cannibals outnumbering missionaries on the boat, making the puzzle unsolvable. This underscores the challenge of continually balancing the groups.

Considering interpretations

OK, let me see. If leaving 0 missionaries on the boat means no one to get eaten, then the puzzle might just have a solution. This prompts a fresh look.

Clarifying ambiguity

I’m addressing the puzzle's ambiguity about constraints when no missionaries are present. Understanding this nuance is crucial for developing an efficient strategy to avoid complications.

Validating the standard solution

This interpretation suggests that leaving 0 missionaries on the boat allows for the standard solution, using 2 cannibals without violating constraints, ensuring safety and balance throughout.

Validating transport logistics

Interestingly enough, I’m ensuring the boat's capacity and trip sequences align with safety rules. Moves should keep passengers in balance, avoiding outnumbering on either side.

Confirming safety measures

I'm thinking through each trip to ensure no missionaries are outnumbered by cannibals. This keeps everyone safe and the approach compliant with the rules.

Kicking off the crossings

I’m figuring out legal moves to ensure no outnumbering. Moving (M, C) across is valid, while (C) cannot return alone. Progress is steady and methodical.

Figuring out the approach

I'm selecting valid trips to prevent outnumbering, ensuring each move keeps passengers balanced and compliant. This helps in crafting a fair solution for everyone involved.

Optimizing strategy

I’m mapping out the best moves to avoid outnumbering missionaries by cannibals, ensuring all are safely transported across the river without any group being overpowered at any point.

Mapping progress

I’m working through each step to ensure a fair, balanced solution, avoiding outnumbering. This guarantees all parties are transported across the river safely and equally.

Evaluating constraints

OK, let me see—interpreting the boat as a separate question might be tricky. Clarifying this issue should help streamline the solution process effectively.

Ensuring balance

I'm mapping out an eleven-step plan where each trip maintains a balanced composition, preventing outnumbering and ensuring all missionaries and cannaibals are safely transported.

Balancing the boat

I'm ensuring each trip transports missionaries and cannibals without outnumbering, carefully considering mission constraints and safety for a structured solution. Progress is steady and methodical.

Piecing it together

I'm finding that the traditional puzzle method isn't working due to the boat constraint, so I'm piecing together a new plan to move all participants safely.

Moving forward

I’m piecing together a strategic plan to transport participants safely, avoiding outnumbering with each shift, and securing all groups effectively.

Charting the course

I’m working through various strategies to ensure safe transport, staying vigilant against outnumbering rules. The target is 11 moves, maintaining safety throughout the journey.

Ensuring no outnumbering

I'm confirming each step ensures safety and balance, avoiding any group being outnumbered. Progress is steady, focusing on full participation and compliance throughout the process.

Crafting a plan

First, I carefully ferry one missionary and one cannibal across, then return the missionary to ensure safety. This method guarantees balance and compliance.

Reworking strategy

OK, let's think this through: adjusting the boat to hold 2 shows new possibilities for resolving the puzzle, considering the tricky constraints.

Ensuring compliance

I'm piecing together each trip to avoid outnumbering missionaries by cannibals, ensuring steady progress and maintaining balance throughout the process.

Ensuring balance

I’m consistently checking each step to make sure no side is outnumbered, maintaining a steady and fair approach throughout the process to keep all participants safe.

Balancing movements

I’m ensuring each trip prevents outnumbering, adhering to rules, and gradually transporting all participants to safety. Progress is evident across the journey.

Mapping the journey

I’m ensuring each trip prevents outnumbering, adhering to rules, and advancing all participants to safety. Progress is evident with each validated step, maintaining balance throughout.

Ensuring a balanced trip

I'm making sure the boat balanced through each move, following rules and progressing safely. This approach keeps all participants together, always making steady progress and ensuring safety.

Balancing every step

I’m really focusing on keeping the boat balanced with each trip, ensuring all participants stay together and safe while dodging the tricky issue of outnumbering.

Below is one of the classic, minimal “3 missionaries and 3 cannibals” solutions in 11 crossings, provided we use the usual convention:

On either bank, cannibals must never outnumber missionaries if there is at least one missionary present there.
On the boat itself, cannibals may not outnumber missionaries if there is at least one missionary on the boat.
If there are 0 missionaries in a location (bank or boat), then it is safe for any number of cannibals to be there (because there are no missionaries to be eaten).
In other words, having 
(C,C)
(C,C) on the boat is allowed as long as there are zero missionaries on the boat, because there is no missionary there to be outnumbered. Many statements of the puzzle assume this convention (otherwise the puzzle becomes unsolvable).

Notation

We will label the banks for clarity:

bank1 = the starting bank (where all 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals begin)
bank2 = the far bank (the goal)
Initially:

bank1 has 3
