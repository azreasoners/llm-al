There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. There is a large cannibal which cannot fit in the boat with another person.

Instance: 
boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries, cannibals and big cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

Thought about missionaries and cannibals problem for 1m 23s
Formulating the approach

I’m piecing together a step-by-step plan to transport 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals across from bank1 to bank2, ensuring the cannibals never outnumber the missionaries at any point.

Mapping the strategy

I'm working through a methodical sequence to ferry 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals (including a large one) across the river without violating constraints, focusing on feasible boat loads and trip alternatives.

Placing pieces

I'm organizing 3 missionaries, 2 regular cannibals, and 1 large cannibal on bank1, ensuring no more cannibals than missionaries on either bank, and alternating trips for balance.

Mapping the strategy

I’m visualizing the mission: ferry 3 missionaries, 2 regular cannibals, and 1 large cannibal to the opposite bank, ensuring no more cannibals than missionaries at any point, and no empty boat crossings.

Mapping intersections

I’m aligning 2 missionaries and 1 large cannibal to cross first, leaving 1 missionary, 1 cannibal, and 1 large cannibal behind. Ensuring the boat always returns to bank1 for balance.

Ensuring balance

I’m piecing together the puzzle constraints, ensuring that cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either bank, including the large cannibal. This leads me to rethink the crossing strategy.

Evaluating the options

I'm figuring out the balance by sending 1 missionary and 1 cannibal first. This leaves 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal, and 1 large cannibal on bank1, which meets the constraints.

Evaluating constraints

I’m thinking through whether the large cannibal is one of the three or separate, and how to manage boat capacity and balance between bank1 and bank2.

Confirming constraints

I’m ensuring the large cannibal is one of the three cannibals, noting the boat's two-person capacity, and maintaining missionary and cannibal balance on both banks throughout the solution.

Assessing transportation options

I’m thinking through the constraints of ferrying 3 missionaries, 2 regular cannibals, and 1 large cannibal, ensuring no more cannibals than missionaries on any bank.

Evaluating crossing methods

Considering different combinations for crossing: 2 missionaries, 1 missionary and 1 cannibal, 1 large cannibal, or 2 normal cannibals, while ensuring missionary dominance on both banks.

Balancing the crossing

Ensuring no more cannibals than missionaries on either bank. Moving 2 missionaries or 1 missionary and 1 cannibal seems promising. Progressing steadily.

Ferrying and bringing back

I’m transporting 1 cannibal back to bank1, ensuring no bank has more cannibals than missionaries. Moving 2 missionaries or 1 missionary and 1 cannibal next seems promising.

Ensuring safe crossings

Sending 1 missionary and 1 cannibal from bank1 to bank2 maintains the balance of missionaries and cannibals on both banks, while keeping the boat's capacity and constraints in check.

Adjusting my approach

I’m testing the balance by sending the large cannibal alone from bank1 to bank2, ensuring no bank eclipses the missionaries with more cannibals. This approach maintains equilibrium on both sides.

Navigating logistics

Returning 1 normal cannibal to bank1 ensures no bank has more cannibals than missionaries, preserving balance. This step maintains equilibrium, making progress towards the solution strategy.

Balancing cannibals

I’m evaluating the balance by sending 2 normal cannibals from bank1 to bank2, ensuring bank1 still has more missionaries than cannibals, and keeping the boat repeatedly back to bank1.

Ensuring balance

I’m verifying that sending 2 normal cannibals to bank2 leaves bank1, which still has more missionaries than cannibals. The boat then returns to bank1 to ferry the missionaries.

Evaluating strategies

I’m trying different combinations to ensure no bank has more cannibals than missionaries. Sending the large cannibal back achieves this balance, while maintaining the constraints and ferry requirements.

Thinking it through

I’m mapping out the options: bringing back 1 missionary and 1 cannibal seems viable, maintaining the balance and ferrying constraints. This approach keeps the solution feasible.

Balancing the strategy

OK, let me see. I’m figuring out how to ferry 1 missionary and 1 cannibal back to bank1. This keeps both banks equally balanced, ensuring no outnumbering of missionaries by cannibals.

Balancing the banks

I’m working through the strategy of sending 2 missionaries from bank1 to bank2, leaving 1 missionary and 1 cannibal behind to ensure no outnumbering on either bank.

Ensuring balance

Returning 1 normal cannibal to bank1 maintains the balance, keeping no bank outnumbered by cannibals compared to missionaries. This approach preserves equilibrium throughout the calculations.

Balancing cannibals and missionaries

I’m thinking through the implications of sending 1 normal cannibal back to bank1. This move keeps the balance intact, ensuring no bank has more cannibals than missionaries.

Balancing the scale

Returning 1 normal cannibal to bank1 ensures equilibrium, with no bank outnumbered by cannibals compared to missionaries. This approach maintains balance throughout the process.

Ensuring balance

Sending 2 normal cannibals from bank1 to bank2 maintains the balance, with bank1 left with 1 large cannibal and 1 normal cannibal, ensuring no outnumbering of missionaries by cannibals.

Evaluating options

OK, let me see. Bringing 1 missionary back to bank1 ensures balance. Sending the large cannibal alone to bank2 is also valid, but sending 2 normal cannibals would break the constraints.

Maintaining equilibrium

Thinking strategically, sending 1 missionary to bank2 ensures equilibrium by keeping the large cannibal alone on bank1, preventing outnumbering and respecting all constraints.

Transporting resources

I’m thinking it through: ferrying 1 normal cannibal back to bank1 to fetch the large cannibal ensures a balanced return, maintaining equilibrium and adhering to constraints.

Balancing transport

Ferrying the large cannibal alone ensures equilibrium, while the boat can relaunch with either 1 normal cannibal or 1 missionary from bank2 to balance bank1.

Balancing constraints

Ensuring no bank outnumbers missionaries by cannibals, the boat returns with 1 normal cannibal or 1 missionary from bank2, preserving balanced states and adhering to constraints.

Balancing constraints

OK, let me see. Ensuring that sending 2 normal cannibals to bank2 doesn't outnumber missionaries by cannibals, even with the large cannibal present, is crucial to maintain balance.

Mapping the journey

Interestingly enough, I’ve outlined a 17-step plan to transport 3 missionaries, 2 normal cannibals, and 1 large cannibal to bank2 without violating constraints, achieving balance and progression.

Charting the course

I'm detailing each move for clarity. The plan is intricate but valid, aiming to transport all missionaries and cannibals to bank2, balancing constraints throughout.

Crafting a plan

Piecing together the solution, I'm ensuring each step respects constraints. A clear, readable form of boat moves or states will showcase progress through this intricate puzzle.

Detailing the puzzle

I’m piecing together the solution, ensuring each boat move respects constraints. This sequence strategically balances missionaries and cannibals, guiding them to safety without breakage.

Below is one (rather explicit) step‐by‐step solution that respects all of the constraints:

We have 3 missionaries (M) and 3 cannibals total, where one of the cannibals is “big” (BC) and therefore cannot share the boat with anyone else.
The other 2 cannibals (C) are “normal” and can ride together or with at most one missionary.
The boat (capacity 2) starts on bank1, and we want everyone safely on bank2.
At no point may cannibals outnumber missionaries on a bank (when missionaries are present), nor on the boat.
Notation
Bank1 
→
→ Bank2 means the boat crosses from bank1 to bank2.
A crossing like 
(

)
(M,C) means “one missionary and one normal cannibal in the boat.”
A crossing like 
(

Now everyone (the 3 missionaries, the 2 normal cannibals, and the big cannibal) is safely on bank2, with no rules ever violated:

The boat was never empty.
On no bank (nor in the boat) did cannibals outnumber missionaries (when missionaries were present).
The big cannibal (BC) always traveled alone in the boat.
This completes a valid solution.
