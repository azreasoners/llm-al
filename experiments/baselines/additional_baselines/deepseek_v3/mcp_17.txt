There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Four missionaries and four cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. However, there is one strong missionary which can row fast. As long as the strong missionary rows, then the cannibals won't become so hungry that they will eat the missionaries. 

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Four missionaries and four cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.
Understanding the Problem
Before diving into solving the puzzle, it's crucial to fully comprehend the constraints and objectives:

Entities Involved:

Missionaries (M): 4

Cannibals (C): 4

Boat: Can carry at most 2 people at once.

Banks: Starting at bank1, goal is to reach bank2.

Constraints:

Boat Movement: The boat cannot cross the river empty; at least one person must be in it.

Safety on Banks: On either bank, if cannibals outnumber missionaries, the missionaries will be eaten.

Safety on Boat: If cannibals outnumber missionaries on the boat, the missionaries will be eaten.

Strong Missionary: There's one strong missionary who can row fast. When this strong missionary is rowing, cannibals won't eat the missionaries on the boat.

Objective: Transport all missionaries and cannibals from bank1 to bank2 without violating any constraints.

Initial Thoughts and Strategy
Given the constraints, the primary challenge is ensuring that at no point do cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank or on the boat. The presence of a strong missionary adds a layer of complexity but also provides a potential advantage in certain scenarios.

To approach this systematically, I'll consider:

Possible Moves: Determine all valid combinations of missionaries and cannibals that can be transported in each trip.

State Representation: Represent the state of the system after each move, keeping track of the number of missionaries and cannibals on each bank and the boat's location.

Backtracking: If a move leads to an invalid state, backtrack and try alternative moves.

Defining the State
A state can be represented as a tuple: (M_left, C_left, boat_position, M_right, C_right), where:

M_left and C_left are the number of missionaries and cannibals on the left bank (bank1).

M_right and C_right are the number of missionaries and cannibals on the right bank (bank2).

boat_position indicates whether the boat is on the left (L) or right (R) bank.

Initially, the state is (4, 4, L, 0, 0).

Validating States
Before making a move, we need to ensure that the resulting state is valid:

On Both Banks:

If there are missionaries on a bank, the number of cannibals should not exceed the number of missionaries.

On the Boat:

If the strong missionary is not rowing, the number of cannibals should not exceed the number of missionaries on the boat.

Possible Moves
The boat can carry 1 or 2 people. Considering the strong missionary's role, let's outline possible moves:

Single Person:

Strong missionary rows alone.

Regular missionary rows alone.

Cannibal rows alone.

Two People:

Strong missionary and regular missionary.

Strong missionary and cannibal.

Two regular missionaries.

Two cannibals.

Regular missionary and cannibal.

However, not all combinations are valid due to the constraints.

Step-by-Step Plan
Let's attempt to outline a sequence of moves, ensuring each step adheres to the constraints.

Step 1: Initial State
Left Bank: 4M, 4C

Boat: Left

Right Bank: 0M, 0C

Step 2: First Crossing
Option A: Send two cannibals to the right bank.

Move: 2C cross to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 4M, 2C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 0M, 2C

Validation:

Left Bank: 4M ≥ 2C → Valid

Right Bank: 0M ≥ 2C → Invalid (cannibals outnumber missionaries)

This move is invalid.

Option B: Send one strong missionary and one cannibal.

Move: 1 strong M and 1C cross to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 3M, 4C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 1M, 1C

Validation:

Left Bank: 3M ≥ 4C → Invalid

Right Bank: 1M ≥ 1C → Valid

This move is invalid due to the left bank.

Option C: Send two missionaries.

Move: 2M cross to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 2M, 4C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 2M, 0C

Validation:

Left Bank: 2M ≥ 4C → Invalid

Right Bank: 2M ≥ 0C → Valid

This move is invalid due to the left bank.

Option D: Send one strong missionary alone.

Move: 1 strong M crosses to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 3M, 4C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 1M, 0C

Validation:

Left Bank: 3M ≥ 4C → Invalid

Right Bank: 1M ≥ 0C → Valid

This move is invalid due to the left bank.

Option E: Send one cannibal alone.

Move: 1C crosses to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 4M, 3C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 0M, 1C

Validation:

Left Bank: 4M ≥ 3C → Valid

Right Bank: 0M ≥ 1C → Invalid

This move is invalid due to the right bank.

Conclusion: None of the initial moves seem valid. This suggests that perhaps we need to reconsider our approach or explore more nuanced moves.

Re-evaluating Initial Moves
Given that sending two cannibals or two missionaries leads to invalid states, perhaps we need to consider sending one strong missionary and one regular missionary.

Option F: Send one strong missionary and one regular missionary.

Move: 1 strong M and 1M cross to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 2M, 4C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 2M, 0C

Validation:

Left Bank: 2M ≥ 4C → Invalid

Right Bank: 2M ≥ 0C → Valid

This move is invalid due to the left bank.

Option G: Send one strong missionary and one cannibal.

Move: 1 strong M and 1C cross to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 3M, 3C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 1M, 1C

Validation:

Left Bank: 3M ≥ 3C → Valid

Right Bank: 1M ≥ 1C → Valid

This move is valid.

Decision: Proceed with Option G.

Step 3: First Crossing - Valid Move
Move: 1 strong M and 1C cross to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 3M, 3C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 1M, 1C

Step 4: Return Trip
Now, someone needs to return to the left bank to transport more people.

Option A: Strong missionary returns alone.

Move: 1 strong M returns to the left.

New State:

Left Bank: 4M, 3C

Boat: Left

Right Bank: 0M, 1C

Validation:

Left Bank: 4M ≥ 3C → Valid

Right Bank: 0M ≥ 1C → Invalid

This move is invalid due to the right bank.

Option B: Cannibal returns alone.

Move: 1C returns to the left.

New State:

Left Bank: 3M, 4C

Boat: Left

Right Bank: 1M, 0C

Validation:

Left Bank: 3M ≥ 4C → Invalid

Right Bank: 1M ≥ 0C → Valid

This move is invalid due to the left bank.

Option C: Both strong missionary and cannibal return.

Move: 1 strong M and 1C return to the left.

New State:

Left Bank: 4M, 4C

Boat: Left

Right Bank: 0M, 0C

This brings us back to the initial state, which isn't helpful.

Conclusion: None of the return moves are valid. This suggests that our initial move might not be the most effective. Let's revisit Step 2.

Revisiting Step 2: Alternative First Crossing
Perhaps sending one strong missionary and one cannibal isn't the best first move. Let's consider sending two cannibals and see if we can adjust subsequent moves to maintain validity.

Option H: Send two cannibals to the right bank.

Move: 2C cross to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 4M, 2C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 0M, 2C

Validation:

Left Bank: 4M ≥ 2C → Valid

Right Bank: 0M ≥ 2C → Invalid

This move is invalid due to the right bank.

Option I: Send one strong missionary and one regular missionary.

Move: 1 strong M and 1M cross to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 2M, 4C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 2M, 0C

Validation:

Left Bank: 2M ≥ 4C → Invalid

Right Bank: 2M ≥ 0C → Valid

This move is invalid due to the left bank.

Option J: Send one strong missionary alone.

Move: 1 strong M crosses to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 3M, 4C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 1M, 0C

Validation:

Left Bank: 3M ≥ 4C → Invalid

Right Bank: 1M ≥ 0C → Valid

This move is invalid due to the left bank.

Option K: Send one regular missionary alone.

Move: 1M crosses to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 3M, 4C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 1M, 0C

Validation:

Left Bank: 3M ≥ 4C → Invalid

Right Bank: 1M ≥ 0C → Valid

This move is invalid due to the left bank.

Option L: Send one cannibal alone.

Move: 1C crosses to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 4M, 3C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 0M, 1C

Validation:

Left Bank: 4M ≥ 3C → Valid

Right Bank: 0M ≥ 1C → Invalid

This move is invalid due to the right bank.

Conclusion: All initial moves seem to lead to invalid states. This suggests that perhaps the problem, as stated, might not have a solution under the given constraints, or that we're missing a critical insight.

Exploring the Role of the Strong Missionary
The strong missionary's ability to row fast and prevent cannibals from eating missionaries on the boat might be the key. Let's consider scenarios where the strong missionary is always rowing, ensuring that cannibals don't outnumber missionaries on the boat.

Revised Strategy:

Always have the strong missionary rowing the boat.

Ensure that when the strong missionary is not on a bank, the number of cannibals does not exceed the number of missionaries on that bank.

Let's attempt the first move again with this in mind.

Step 2: First Crossing with Strong Missionary Rowing
Move: Strong missionary and one cannibal cross to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 3M, 3C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 1M, 1C

Validation:

Left Bank: 3M ≥ 3C → Valid

Right Bank: 1M ≥ 1C → Valid

This move is valid.

Step 3: Return Trip
Now, the strong missionary needs to return to the left bank to transport more people.

Move: Strong missionary returns alone.

New State:

Left Bank: 4M, 3C

Boat: Left

Right Bank: 0M, 1C

Validation:

Left Bank: 4M ≥ 3C → Valid

Right Bank: 0M ≥ 1C → Invalid

This move is invalid due to the right bank.

Alternative Return Move: Perhaps the strong missionary can bring someone back.

Move: Strong missionary and one cannibal return to the left.

New State:

Left Bank: 4M, 4C

Boat: Left

Right Bank: 0M, 0C

This brings us back to the initial state, which isn't helpful.

Conclusion: This approach also leads to a dead end. It seems that the problem, as stated, might not have a solution under the given constraints, or perhaps there's a more nuanced strategy that we're missing.

Considering Alternative Strategies
Perhaps transporting two cannibals at a time, despite the initial invalidity, could be part of a larger sequence that eventually balances out the numbers.

Let's attempt:

Move 1: Two cannibals cross to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 4M, 2C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 0M, 2C

Validation:

Left Bank: 4M ≥ 2C → Valid

Right Bank: 0M ≥ 2C → Invalid

This move is invalid due to the right bank.

Move 2: One cannibal returns to the left.

New State:

Left Bank: 4M, 3C

Boat: Left

Right Bank: 0M, 1C

Validation:

Left Bank: 4M ≥ 3C → Valid

Right Bank: 0M ≥ 1C → Invalid

This move is invalid due to the right bank.

Conclusion: This approach also doesn't yield a valid sequence.

Final Attempt: Combining Different Moves
Perhaps a combination of different moves can lead to a valid sequence. Let's try:

Move 1: Strong missionary and one cannibal cross to the right.

New State:

Left Bank: 3M, 3C

Boat: Right

Right Bank: 1M, 1C

Validation:

Left Bank: 3M ≥ 3C → Valid

Right Bank: 1M ≥ 1C → Valid

Move 2: Strong missionary returns alone.

New State:

Left Bank: 4M, 3C

Boat: Left

Right Bank: 0M, 1C

Validation:

Left Bank: 4M ≥ 3C → Valid

Right Bank: 0M ≥ 1C → Invalid

This move is invalid due to the right bank.

Alternative Move 2: Strong missionary brings one cannibal back.

New State:

Left Bank: 4M, 4C

Boat: Left

Right Bank: 0M, 0C

This brings us back to the initial state.

Conclusion: Despite multiple attempts, it seems challenging to find a sequence of moves that satisfies all constraints. This suggests that the problem, as stated, might not have a solution, or that additional rules or flexibility are needed to find a valid sequence.

Final Answer
After thoroughly exploring various strategies and sequences of moves, it appears that the given constraints make it impossible to transport all four missionaries and four cannibals from bank1 to bank2 without violating the safety conditions at some point. The presence of the strong missionary provides some flexibility, but the fundamental issue of maintaining a safe ratio of missionaries to cannibals on both banks and the boat proves too restrictive in this scenario.

Therefore, there is no valid plan under the current constraints that allows all missionaries and cannibals to safely cross the river.
