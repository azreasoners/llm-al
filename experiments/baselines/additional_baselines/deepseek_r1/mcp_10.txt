There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. Additionally, one of the missionaries is Jesus, who can walk across by walking on the water. 
Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.
Okay, so I need to solve this missionaries and cannibals problem, but there's a twist with Jesus being able to walk across the river. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the classic problem: three missionaries and three cannibals need to cross the river with a boat that can hold up to two people. The constraints are that on either bank, the cannibals can't outnumber the missionaries, and the same applies to the boat. Now, adding Jesus here—he can walk across by himself without using the boat. That must be a key part of the solution.

So, normally, without Jesus, the solution requires careful back-and-forth trips to ensure that the numbers never go wrong. But with Jesus being able to walk, maybe we can use him to adjust the counts on either side without using the boat. That could reduce the number of crossings needed or make the problem easier by avoiding some of the tricky steps.

Let me outline the starting state:

Bank1: 3M (including Jesus), 3C, Boat

Bank2: 0M, 0C

Goal: All on Bank2.

Constraints:

1. On any bank, if there are missionaries, the number of cannibals must not exceed the missionaries.

2. On the boat, same rule: cannibals can't outnumber missionaries.

3. Boat capacity is 2, must have at least one person to cross.

4. Jesus can walk across alone, which means he can move from one bank to the other without the boat. But does this take time? I guess it's instantaneous, or maybe he can do it during a boat trip? Hmm, the problem says "walk across by walking on the water," so maybe he can just go from one side to the other whenever, but how does that interact with the boat movements?

Wait, the problem says "Find a plan"—so maybe each step is either a boat trip or Jesus walking. So Jesus can move independently of the boat. That's a big help. So, for example, if Jesus is on Bank1, he can just move to Bank2 without affecting the boat's position or the other people. But the others have to use the boat.

Let me consider how Jesus's ability can be used. Since he's a missionary, moving him to the other side can help balance the numbers. For instance, if we send two cannibals in the boat to Bank2, then Bank1 would have 3M and 1C, which is safe. Then, Jesus can walk over to Bank2, making Bank2 have 1M (Jesus) and 2C. Then Bank1 has 2M and 1C. But then maybe send the boat back with one cannibal... Hmm, maybe that's a way to manage the counts.

Wait, let's start step by step.

Initial state:

Bank1: M1 (Jesus), M2, M3, C1, C2, C3; Boat present

Bank2: None

First, maybe send two cannibals over. Boat takes C1 and C2 to Bank2. Now:

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: C1, C2

But now, the boat is on Bank2. We need to get it back. But who can bring it back? If we send one cannibal back, but the boat can't cross empty. So someone has to come back. But the missionaries are all on Bank1. Wait, no—Bank2 has two cannibals. If the boat is there, a cannibal has to bring it back. Let's say one cannibal (C1) takes the boat back. Now:

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C3, C1; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: C2

But Bank1 now has 3Ms and 2Cs, which is safe (2C vs 3M). Bank2 has 1C. Then, maybe send Jesus to walk over to Bank2. So:

Bank1: M2, M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1 (Jesus), C2

Now, on Bank1, 2M and 2C. But wait, that's 2M and 2C. Cannibals equal missionaries, which is allowed (since they don't outnumber). So that's okay. Then, maybe take two missionaries in the boat to Bank2. Wait, but the boat can hold two. But if we take M2 and M3, leaving C1 and C3 on Bank1, that would leave 0M and 2C on Bank1, which is not allowed. So that's bad.

Alternatively, maybe take one missionary and one cannibal. Let's try that. From Bank1: M2 and C1 take the boat to Bank2. Now:

Bank1: M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C2, M2, C1

But now Bank1 has 1M and 1C, which is safe. Bank2 has 3M (including Jesus) and 3C, which is safe. Wait, but how? M1, M2, and M3 are all on Bank2, and C1, C2, C3? Wait no, after the first trip:

First trip: C1 and C2 go to Bank2. Then C1 comes back. Then Jesus walks over. So Bank2 has M1 and C2. Then the next trip: M2 and C1 go over. Now Bank2 has M1, M2, C1, C2. Bank1 has M3 and C3. Then, the boat is at Bank2. Now, someone needs to take the boat back. Maybe M2 comes back? But that would leave Bank2 with M1 and C1, C2. Which is 1M and 2C—cannibals outnumber. Not allowed. So M2 can't come back. Maybe C1 comes back. Then Bank2 has M1, M2, C2. Bank1 gets C1 back. But then Bank1 has M3, C3, C1. Which is 1M and 2C, which is bad. So that's not allowed.

Hmm. Maybe this approach isn't working. Let's try a different initial move. Since Jesus can walk, maybe we can use him to adjust the counts.

Alternative plan: Have Jesus walk to Bank2 first. Then, on Bank1: M2, M3, 3C; Bank2: M1. Then, use the boat to transport cannibals and missionaries as usual, but with Jesus already on Bank2, maybe that helps.

Let's see:

Step 1: Jesus walks to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C1, C2, C3; Boat

Bank2: M1

Now, Bank1 has 2Ms and 3Cs. Wait, cannibals outnumber missionaries (3C vs 2M). That's not allowed. So that's a problem. So we can't leave Bank1 with 2Ms and 3Cs. Therefore, Jesus can't just walk over immediately because that would make Bank1 unsafe.

So maybe we need to first move some people before Jesus walks.

Alternatively, maybe send one missionary and one cannibal in the boat first. Let's try that.

Step 1: Boat takes M1 (Jesus) and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C2, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C1

Now, check constraints:

Bank1: 2M, 2C. Safe.

Bank2: 1M, 1C. Safe.

Boat: When they were on the boat, M1 and C1—cannibal doesn't outnumber (1 vs 1), allowed.

Then, Jesus can walk back? Wait, can he walk back? The problem says he can walk across by walking on water. So maybe he can go either direction whenever. So after Step 1, M1 is on Bank2. He can choose to walk back to Bank1 if needed, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe the boat returns with C1.

Step 2: Boat returns with C1 to Bank1.

Bank1: M2, M3, C1, C2, C3; Boat

Bank2: M1

But Bank1 now has 2M and 3C. Again, cannibals outnumber, which is not allowed. So that's bad. So that approach doesn't work.

Hmm. Maybe we need to use Jesus's ability more strategically. Let's think: since Jesus can move without the boat, perhaps after some initial crossings, he can balance the numbers.

Let me try sending two cannibals first, as before.

Step 1: Boat takes C1 and C2 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: C1, C2

Now, Bank1 is safe (3M,1C). Bank2 has 2C. Then, Step 2: Boat returns with one cannibal. Let's say C1 comes back.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1, C3; Boat

Bank2: C2

Bank1 has 3M and 2C. Safe. Then Step 3: Jesus walks to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C1, C3; Boat

Bank2: M1, C2

Bank1: 2M, 2C. Safe. Bank2: 1M,1C. Safe.

Now, Step 4: Take two missionaries from Bank1 to Bank2. But if we take M2 and M3, then Bank1 would have 0M and 2C, which is unsafe. So can't do that. Alternatively, take one M and one C.

Step 4: Boat takes M2 and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C2, M2, C1

Bank1: 1M,1C. Safe. Bank2: 2M,2C. Safe.

Then, Step 5: Boat needs to return. Who can go back? If C1 or C2 comes back. Let's say C1 returns.

Bank1: M3, C3, C1; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, M2, C2

Bank1: 1M, 2C. Cannibals outnumber. Not allowed. So that's bad.

Alternatively, send M2 back. Then Bank2 would have M1 and C2, C1. Bank1 gets M2 back.

But Bank2 would have 1M and 2C, which is unsafe. So that's not allowed.

Hmm. Maybe send M1 back with the boat. Wait, M1 is on Bank2. If he takes the boat back, but he's Jesus. Wait, can Jesus both walk and use the boat? The problem states he can walk across by walking on water. So maybe he doesn't need the boat, but can he still use it if he wants? The problem doesn't say he can't. But perhaps it's more efficient to have him walk.

But in this case, if the boat is on Bank2, someone needs to take it back. If M1 (Jesus) takes the boat back, then Bank2 would have M2, C1, C2. Which is 1M and 2C—unsafe. So that's not allowed.

Alternatively, maybe send C2 back. Then Bank2 would have M1, M2, C1. Bank1 gets C2. Bank1: M3, C3, C2. Which is 1M and 2C—bad.

This approach isn't working. Let's try a different initial move.

Alternative approach: Use Jesus to shuttle without the boat. For instance, after some crossings, Jesus can walk over to adjust the numbers.

Let me try:

Step 1: Boat takes M1 (Jesus) and M2 to Bank2.

Bank1: M3, C1, C2, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, M2

But Bank1 has 1M and 3C. Cannibals outnumber. Not allowed. So bad.

Step 1: Boat takes M1 and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C2, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C1

Bank1: 2M, 2C. Safe. Bank2: 1M,1C. Safe.

Step 2: Jesus walks back to Bank1.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C2, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: C1

But Bank1 now has 3M and 2C. Safe. Bank2 has 1C.

Step 3: Boat needs to return. Since it's at Bank2, someone has to take it back. Maybe C1 takes it back.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1, C2, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: Empty

But that just undoes the first step. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe after Step1, instead of Jesus walking back, send the boat back with C1.

Step1: M1 and C1 go to Bank2.

Step2: C1 returns.

Now, Bank1: M1 (wait, no—if M1 and C1 went to Bank2 in Step1, then when C1 returns, Bank1 would have M2, M3, C1, C2, C3. Bank2 has M1.

Wait, no: Step1: M1 and C1 go to Bank2. So Bank1 loses M1 and C1. So Bank1 has M2, M3, C2, C3. Then, Step2: C1 comes back. So Bank1 gets C1 back. So Bank1: M2, M3, C1, C2, C3. Bank2: M1. But now Bank1 has 2M and 3C. Cannibals outnumber. Not allowed.

So that's not good. So maybe that approach is invalid.

Hmm. Maybe the key is to use Jesus's ability to walk over after some people have crossed, thereby balancing the numbers without needing a boat trip.

Let me think again. Suppose we first send two cannibals over.

Step1: C1 and C2 go to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: C1, C2

Bank1 is safe (3M,1C). Bank2 is safe (0M,2C).

Step2: Boat returns with one cannibal. Let's say C1 comes back.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: C2

Bank1: 3M,2C. Safe.

Step3: Now, Jesus can walk to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, C2

Bank1: 2M,2C. Safe. Bank2: 1M,1C. Safe.

Step4: Now, send two missionaries from Bank1 to Bank2. But if we send M2 and M3, Bank1 would have 0M and 2C. Bad. So instead, send one M and one C.

Step4: M2 and C1 go to Bank2.

Bank1: M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C2, M2, C1

Bank1: 1M,1C. Safe. Bank2: 2M,2C. Safe.

Step5: Now, the boat is at Bank2. We need to get it back. If C1 or C2 returns. Let's say C1 returns.

Bank1: M3, C3, C1; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, C2, M2

Bank1: 1M,2C. Cannibals outnumber. Not allowed.

Alternatively, send M2 back.

Bank2 becomes M1, C2. Bank1 gets M2 back. Bank1: M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank1

But Bank2 has M1 and C2: 1M and 1C. Safe. Bank1 has 2M and 1C. Safe.

Then Step5: Boat takes M2 and M3 to Bank2.

But boat capacity is 2. So they can go together.

Bank1: C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, M2, M3, C2

Wait, but then Bank1 has 0M and 1C. Safe. Bank2 has 3M and 1C. Safe.

Then, boat is at Bank2. Now, we need to get C3 over. But the boat is at Bank2. So someone needs to take the boat back. Let's say C2 goes back.

Bank1: C3, C2; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, M2, M3

Bank1: 0M, 2C. Safe. Bank2: 3M, 0C. Safe.

Then, take C2 and C3 to Bank2. Boat takes both.

Bank1: Empty; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: All people.

But wait, in this case, all missionaries are already on Bank2. The remaining cannibals are C2 and C3 on Bank1. So after Step5: Bank2 has 3M and C2. Then Step6: Boat goes back with C2 to pick up C3. But wait, let me retrace.

Wait, after Step5: Bank1 has C3, and boat is at Bank1 if we did that. Wait no, let me clarify:

After Step4: Bank1 has M3 and C3; Bank2 has M1, M2, C1, C2. Boat is at Bank2.

Step5: Boat needs to go back. If M2 takes it back:

Bank1: M3, C3, M2; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, C1, C2

Bank1: 2M,2C. Safe. Bank2:1M,2C. Cannibals outnumber. Not allowed. So that's bad.

Alternatively, send C1 back.

Bank1: M3, C3, C1; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, M2, C2

Bank1:1M,2C. Bad.

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe after Step4, when Bank1 has 1M and 1C (M3 and C3), and Bank2 has 2M and 2C (M1, M2, C1, C2), we need to get the boat back. Maybe send Jesus (M1) back with the boat. But M1 is on Bank2. If he takes the boat back:

Bank1: M3, C3, M1; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M2, C1, C2

Bank1:2M,1C. Safe. Bank2:1M,2C. Not safe. So can't do that.

Alternatively, send C2 back.

Bank1: M3, C3, C2; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, M2, C1

Bank1:1M,2C. Bad.

This approach isn't working. Maybe we need to adjust earlier steps.

Let's go back to Step3:

After Step3: Bank1 has M2, M3, C1, C3; Bank2 has M1, C2.

Step4: Instead of sending M2 and C1, maybe send two Cs from Bank1. Wait, Bank1 has C1 and C3. So send C1 and C3 to Bank2.

But boat capacity is 2. So Step4: Boat takes C1 and C3 to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C2, C1, C3

Bank1: 2M. Safe. Bank2:1M,3C. Cannibals outnumber. Not allowed. So that's bad.

Hmm. Maybe send one C and one M. Let's try M2 and C3.

Step4: Boat takes M2 and C3 to Bank2.

Bank1: M3, C1; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C2, M2, C3

Bank1:1M,1C. Safe. Bank2:2M,2C. Safe.

Then Step5: Boat needs to return. Send M2 back.

Bank1: M3, C1, M2; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, C2, C3

Bank1:2M,1C. Safe. Bank2:1M,2C. Not safe. So bad.

Alternatively, send C3 back.

Bank1: M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, C2, M2

Bank1:1M,2C. Bad.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe the key is to use Jesus's ability to walk over at a specific time to balance the numbers.

Let's try a different approach. Start by sending two cannibals.

Step1: C1 and C2 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Step2: C1 returns.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: C2

Step3: Send Jesus (M1) to walk to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, C2

Now, Bank1 has 2M and 2C. Safe. Bank2:1M,1C. Safe.

Step4: Send M2 and M3 to Bank2 by boat. But boat can take 2. But leaving Bank1 with C1 and C3 (0M, 2C). Not allowed. So can't do that.

Alternative Step4: Send M2 and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C2, M2, C1

Bank1:1M,1C. Safe.

Step5: Now, boat is at Bank2. Need to send it back. Send C1 back.

Bank1: M3, C3, C1; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, C2, M2

Bank1:1M,2C. Bad.

Alternatively, send M2 back.

Bank2: M1, C2. Bank1: M3, C3, M2.

Bank1:2M,1C. Safe.

Bank2:1M,1C. Safe.

Step5: Now, Boat is at Bank1. Take M2 and C3 to Bank2.

Bank1: M3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C2, M2, C3

Bank1:1M. Safe. Bank2:2M,2C. Safe.

Step6: Boat needs to return. Send C3 back.

Bank1: M3, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, C2, M2

Step7: Take C3 and M3 to Bank2.

Bank1: Empty. Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, M2, M3, C2, C3

But C1 is still on Bank1? Wait, no. Let's retrace.

Wait, after Step1: C1 and C2 go to Bank2. Then C1 returns. Then Jesus walks over. Then M2 and C1 go to Bank2. Then M2 returns. Then M2 and C3 go to Bank2. Then C3 returns. Then M3 and C3 go. Wait, this is getting convoluted. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, after Step4: Bank1 has M3, C3; Bank2 has M1, C2, M2, C1.

Then, Jesus is on Bank2. Can he walk back? If he does:

Step5: Jesus walks back to Bank1.

Bank1: M1, M3, C3; Bank2: C2, M2, C1.

Now, Bank1 has 2M,1C. Safe. Bank2 has 1M,2C. Not safe. So that's bad.

Alternatively, after Step4, use the boat to send someone else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's try a different approach.

Since Jesus can walk across, maybe after some initial crossings, he can go to Bank2 to balance the numbers.

Alternative Plan:

Step1: Boat takes C1 and C2 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Step2: C1 returns.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: C2

Step3: Jesus walks to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, C2

Step4: Boat takes C1 and C3 to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C2, C1, C3

Bank1: 2M. Safe. Bank2:1M,3C. Not safe. Oops.

That's a problem. So sending both cannibals causes issues. Instead, Step4: Boat takes M2 and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C2, M2, C1

Bank1:1M,1C. Safe.

Step5: Boat returns with C1.

Bank1: M3, C3, C1; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, C2, M2

Bank1:1M,2C. Bad.

Alternatively, boat returns with M2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, C2, C1

Bank2:1M,2C. Bad.

Hmm. Maybe we need to involve Jesus more. After Step3, Bank2 has M1 and C2. Bank1 has M2, M3, C1, C3.

Step4: Boat takes M2 and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, M2, C1, C2

Bank1:1M,1C. Safe. Bank2:2M,2C. Safe.

Step5: Jesus walks back to Bank1.

Bank1: M1, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M2, C1, C2

Bank1:2M,1C. Safe. Bank2:1M,2C. Not safe.

Not good. Alternatively, boat returns with C1.

Bank1: M3, C3, C1; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, M2, C2

Bank1:1M,2C. Bad.

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution requires sending Jesus over early to help balance.

Wait, what if after Step3 (Bank1: M2, M3, C1, C3; Bank2: M1, C2), we send Jesus (M1) back to Bank1 via walking? Wait, he's on Bank2. If he walks back:

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1, C3; Bank2: C2

But Bank1 has 3M,2C. Safe. Bank2:1C. Safe.

Then, take two missionaries to Bank2.

Step4: Boat takes M1 and M2 to Bank2.

Bank1: M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, M2, C2

Bank1:1M,2C. Bad.

No good. Alternatively, take M3 and C1.

Step4: Boat takes M3 and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M3, C1, C2, M1 (if Jesus is there? Wait, M1 is on Bank2 already from Step3. Wait, no. After Step3, M1 is on Bank2. Then Step4: M1 walks back to Bank1. Then Bank1 has M1, M2, M3, C1, C3. Bank2 has C2.

Then Step4: Boat takes M1 and M2 to Bank2. Bank1: M3, C1, C3. Bank2: M1, M2, C2. Bank1 is 1M,2C. Bad.

This is not working. I need to think differently.

Alternative Idea: Use Jesus to move back and forth to adjust counts without using the boat. Since he can walk, he can be on either bank as needed.

Let's try:

Step1: Boat takes C1 and C2 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Step2: C1 returns.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank1

Step3: Jesus walks to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C1, C3; Bank2: M1, C2

Step4: Boat takes C1 and C3 to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C2, C1, C3

But Bank2 has 1M and 3C. Bad.

Step4 alternative: Boat takes M2 and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C2, M2, C1

Bank1:1M,1C. Safe.

Step5: Jesus walks back to Bank1.

Bank1: M1, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M2, C1, C2

Bank1:2M,1C. Safe. Bank2:1M,2C. Not safe.

Not good.

Step5 alternative: Boat returns with C1.

Bank1: M3, C3, C1; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, C2, M2

Bank1:1M,2C. Bad.

I'm going in circles here. Let's try to find a different path.

What if we start by sending one missionary and one cannibal?

Step1: Boat takes M1 (Jesus) and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C2, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C1

Both banks are safe.

Step2: Jesus walks back to Bank1.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C2, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: C1

Step3: Boat takes C1 and C2 to Bank2.

But the boat is at Bank2. To get it back, someone needs to bring it. Since Bank2 has C1, C1 can take the boat back.

Step2a: After Step1, boat is at Bank2. Step2: C1 returns with the boat.

Bank1: M2, M3, C1, C2, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1

Bank1 has 2M and 3C. Not safe.

No good.

Alternative Step2: After Step1, Jesus (M1) walks back, then boat returns with C1.

Wait, after Step1, M1 and C1 are on Bank2. Jesus can walk back to Bank1, making Bank1 have M1, M2, M3, C2, C3. Bank2 has C1. But then Bank1 has 3M and 2C. Safe. Bank2 has 1C.

Then, boat is at Bank2. To return, C1 takes it back.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1, C2, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: Empty.

That undoes everything. Not helpful.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me look up the standard solution to the missionaries and cannibals problem and see how Jesus's ability can modify it.

Standard solution for 3M and 3C:

1. Two cannibals cross.

2. One returns.

3. Two cannibals cross again.

4. One returns.

5. Two missionaries cross.

6. A missionary and a cannibal return.

7. Two missionaries cross.

8. A cannibal returns.

9. Two cannibals cross.

10. A cannibal returns.

11. Two cannibals cross.

But that's for a different boat capacity. Wait, no—the classic problem has a boat capacity of two, and the solution involves several crossings where they shuttle back and forth, ensuring the numbers are safe.

But in our case, adding Jesus who can walk across might allow us to skip some steps. For example, when a missionary needs to return, Jesus can just walk over instead of using the boat.

Let me try adapting the standard solution with Jesus's ability.

Standard Step1: Send two cannibals to Bank2.

Bank1: 3M,1C; Bank2: 0M,2C.

Step2: Send one cannibal back.

Bank1: 3M,2C; Bank2:0M,1C.

Step3: Send two cannibals again.

Bank1:3M,0C; Bank2:0M,3C.

But this leaves all missionaries on Bank1 and all cannibals on Bank2. Then send one missionary to cross with a cannibal, etc.

But with Jesus, maybe we can avoid some steps. For example, after Step1: two cannibals cross. Then Jesus walks over to Bank2, making Bank2 have 1M and 2C. Bank1 has 2M and 1C. Then send one cannibal back. But I need to think through.

Alternatively, let's try integrating Jesus's walking into the solution.

Step1: Boat takes C1 and C2 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Step2: Jesus walks to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C3; Bank2: M1, C1, C2

Bank1:2M,1C. Safe. Bank2:1M,2C. Not safe. Oops, so that's bad. So can't have Jesus walk there yet.

Step2 alternative: C1 returns with the boat.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: C2

Bank1:3M,2C. Safe.

Step3: Boat takes M1 and M2 to Bank2.

Bank1: M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: C2, M1, M2

Bank1:1M,2C. Bad.

Hmm. Not good. Maybe send M1 and C1 instead.

Step3: Boat takes M1 and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: C2, M1, C1

Bank1:2M,1C. Safe. Bank2:1M,2C. Not safe.

No good.

Step3 alternative: Boat takes M3 and C3 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, C1; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: C2, M3, C3

Bank1:2M,1C. Safe. Bank2:1M,2C. Not safe.

Still bad.

This is really challenging. Maybe the key is that Jesus can move freely, so after certain steps, he can balance the counts.

Wait, here's an idea:

1. Send two cannibals to Bank2.

2. Jesus walks to Bank2, making Bank2 have 1M and 2C.

3. Then send one cannibal back, leaving Bank2 with 1M and 1C.

4. Now, Bank1 has 2M and 2C. Send two missionaries to Bank2.

5. But that leaves Bank1 with 0M and 2C. So instead, maybe send one M and one C.

6. Continue accordingly.

Let's try:

Step1: C1 and C2 cross to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: C1, C2

Step2: Jesus walks to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C3; Bank2: M1, C1, C2

Bank1:2M,1C. Safe. Bank2:1M,2C. Not safe. Problem here.

So that's not allowed. So Step2 can't happen.

Alternative approach: Use Jesus to be on the boat when needed to prevent cannibals from outnumbering.

For example:

Step1: Boat takes M1 (Jesus) and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C2, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C1

Both banks safe.

Step2: Jesus walks back to Bank1.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C2, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: C1

Step3: C1 takes the boat back to Bank1.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1, C2, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: Empty.

This just resets to the start. Useless.

Alternatively, after Step1, boat returns with C1.

Bank1: M2, M3, C1, C2, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1

But Bank1 has 2M and 3C. Not allowed.

Hmm. Maybe this is impossible without using the standard solution steps, but incorporating Jesus's ability to reduce steps.

Wait, perhaps the key is that Jesus can be on either bank whenever needed, so after some crossings, he can adjust the counts. Let's try the following:

Step1: Boat takes C1 and C2 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Step2: C1 returns.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank1

Step3: Boat takes C3 and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: C1, C2, C3

Bank1:3M. Safe. Bank2:3C. Safe.

Step4: Jesus walks to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3; Bank2: M1, C1, C2, C3

Bank1:2M. Safe. Bank2:1M,3C. Not safe.

No good.

Alternative Step3: Boat takes M1 and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, C1, C2

Bank1:2M,1C. Safe. Bank2:1M,2C. Not safe.

Ugh. This is frustrating.

Wait, maybe the answer lies in realizing that with Jesus's ability, we can have him on Bank2 early to offset the cannibal count.

For example:

Step1: Jesus walks to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C1, C2, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1

Bank1:2M,3C. Not safe. Can't do that.

So that's invalid.

Another Idea: Use the boat to take one missionary and one cannibal, then have Jesus walk over to help.

Step1: Boat takes M2 and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M3, C2, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M2, C1

Step2: Jesus walks to Bank2.

Bank1: M3, C2, C3; Bank2: M1, M2, C1

Bank1:1M,2C. Bad.

No good.

Step2 alternative: M2 returns with the boat.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C2, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: C1

Bank1:3M,2C. Safe. Bank2:1C.

Step3: Boat takes C2 and C3 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: C1, C2, C3

Step4: C1 returns.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: C2, C3

Step5: Boat takes M1, M2, M3 to Bank2 two at a time. But boat can only take two. So multiple trips. But this seems inefficient and may not work.

Alternatively, after Step3, Bank2 has C1, C2, C3 and boat. Bank1 has 3M. Then, send two missionaries to Bank2.

Step4: Boat takes M1 and M2 to Bank2.

Bank1: M3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, M2, C1, C2, C3

Bank1:1M. Safe. Bank2:2M,3C. Not safe.

No good.

I'm clearly missing something. Let's try to think outside the box. Since Jesus can walk, perhaps he can stay on Bank2 while others are ferried over, ensuring that there's always at least one missionary there.

Alternative Plan:

1. Jesus walks to Bank2.

But this leaves Bank1 with 2Ms and 3Cs. Not allowed.

So can't do that.

2. Boat takes two cannibals to Bank2.

Then, Bank1:3M,1C. Safe.

3. Boat returns with one cannibal.

Bank1:3M,2C. Safe.

4. Boat takes two cannibals to Bank2.

Bank1:3M. Safe.

5. Boat returns with one cannibal.

Bank1:3M,1C.

6. Boat takes two missionaries to Bank2.

Bank1:1M,1C. Safe.

But this is part of the standard solution. However, with Jesus, maybe step 6 can be adjusted.

Wait, after step4, all cannibals are on Bank2 except one. Then Jesus is on Bank1. If he walks to Bank2, then Bank2 has 1M and 3C. Not safe. So that's bad.

Alternatively, after step4 (all cannibals on Bank2), then Jesus walks over.

Bank2:1M,3C. Bad.

No.

Alternatively, during the standard solution, use Jesus to replace a missionary's return trip. For example, in the standard solution, after two missionaries cross, a missionary and cannibal return. But instead of a missionary returning, Jesus can walk back, allowing the boat to carry someone else.

Let's try adapting the standard solution with Jesus:

Standard steps:

1. Two cannibals cross.

2. One cannibal returns.

3. Two cannibals cross.

4. One cannibal returns.

5. Two missionaries cross.

6. One missionary and one cannibal return.

7. Two missionaries cross.

8. One cannibal returns.

9. Two cannibals cross.

10. One cannibal returns.

11. Two cannibals cross.

With Jesus:

1. Two cannibals cross (C1, C2 to Bank2).

2. One cannibal returns (C1).

3. Two cannibals cross (C1, C3 to Bank2). Wait, but C1 is back, so maybe C3 and C1 go.

4. One cannibal returns (C1).

5. Two missionaries cross (M1, M2).

6. Instead of a missionary and cannibal returning, Jesus walks back (so M1 returns via walking, but he's Jesus).

7. Then two missionaries cross (M1, M3).

Wait, let's detail this:

Step1: C1 and C2 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Step2: C1 returns.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank1

Step3: C1 and C3 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: C1, C2, C3

Step4: C1 returns.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: C2, C3

Step5: M1 and M2 to Bank2.

Bank1: M3, C1; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, M2, C2, C3

Step6: Now, instead of sending a missionary and cannibal back, Jesus (M1) walks back to Bank1.

Bank1: M1, M3, C1; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M2, C2, C3

Step7: Now, send M1 and M3 to Bank2 via boat.

Bank1: Empty; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, M2, M3, C2, C3

But C1 is still on Bank1. Oops. Forgot about C1.

Wait, after Step5: Bank1 has M3 and C1. Then Step6: M1 walks back, making Bank1: M1, M3, C1. Bank2: M2, C2, C3.

Step7: Boat takes M1 and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: M3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, M2, C1, C2, C3

Bank1:1M. Safe. Bank2:3M,3C. Safe.

Then, boat is at Bank2. Need to get M3 over. So send someone back. Send C1 back.

Bank1: M3, C1; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, M2, C2, C3

Step8: Boat takes M3 and C1 to Bank2.

Bank1: Empty; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: All people.

But this works! Let's verify the steps:

Step1: C1 and C2 to Bank2. Bank1: 3M,1C. Bank2:0M,2C.

Step2: C1 returns. Bank1:3M,2C. Bank2:0M,1C.

Step3: C1 and C3 to Bank2. Bank1:3M. Bank2:0M,3C.

Step4: C1 returns. Bank1:3M,1C. Bank2:0M,2C.

Step5: M1 and M2 to Bank2. Bank1:1M,1C. Bank2:2M,2C.

Step6: M1 (Jesus) walks back. Bank1:2M,1C. Bank2:1M,2C.

Step7: M1 and C1 take boat to Bank2. Bank1:0M,0C. Bank2:3M,3C.

Wait, no. After Step5: Bank1 has M3 and C1. Step6: M1 walks back to Bank1, making Bank1: M1, M3, C1. Step7: Boat takes M1 and C1 to Bank2. Then Bank1 has M3. Bank2 has M1, M2, C1, C2, C3. Then send C1 back to get M3. Wait, but in Step7, after taking M1 and C1 to Bank2, Bank1 is left with M3. Then send someone back to get M3.

But Bank2 has all cannibals and M1, M2. So send C1 back. Boat takes C1 to Bank1, picks up M3, and returns.

But this is additional steps. However, with Jesus's ability, maybe after Step7, M3 can be taken over.

But according to the steps above, after Step7, Bank1 has M3, and Bank2 has everyone else except M3. Then:

Step8: C1 returns to Bank1.

Bank1: M3, C1; Boat at Bank1

Step9: Boat takes M3 and C1 to Bank2.

All on Bank2.

But during Step8, when C1 returns to Bank1, Bank2 has M1, M2, C2, C3. Which is 2M and 2C. Safe. Bank1 has M3 and C1:1M and1C. Safe.

Then Step9: M3 and C1 go to Bank2. Now all are there. But on the boat, M3 and C1: cannibal doesn't outnumber. Safe.

Bank2 now has 3M and 3C. All safe.

So the steps would be:

1. C1 and C2 cross to Bank2.

2. C1 returns.

3. C1 and C3 cross to Bank2.

4. C1 returns.

5. M1 and M2 cross to Bank2.

6. M1 (Jesus) walks back to Bank1.

7. M1 and C1 cross to Bank2.

8. C1 returns to Bank1.

9. M3 and C1 cross to Bank2.

But this is 9 steps, and uses Jesus's ability once in step6. However, the problem states that the boat's capacity is 2, and we need to get everyone to Bank2. But the steps above work, but maybe there's a shorter way using Jesus's ability to reduce steps.

Alternatively, after step5: Bank1 has M3 and C1. Bank2 has M1, M2, C2, C3. Then, Jesus can walk back to Bank1, making Bank1 have M1, M3, C1. Then boat takes M1 and C1 to Bank2, leaving M3. Then C1 returns to get M3. But that's similar to above.

Alternatively, after step5: Bank1 has M3 and C1. Bank2 has M1, M2, C2, C3. Then, Jesus (M1) can walk back to Bank1, and then take M3 in the boat.

Step6: M1 walks back to Bank1.

Bank1: M1, M3, C1; Bank2: M2, C2, C3

Step7: Boat takes M1 and M3 to Bank2.

Bank1: C1; Bank2: M1, M2, M3, C2, C3

Step8: C1 takes the boat back.

Bank1: C1; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: M1, M2, M3, C2, C3

Step9: Boat takes C1 to Bank2.

All on Bank2.

But steps 7-9 are necessary. However, this uses Jesus's ability to reduce the number of crossings.

But in the initial steps, we still needed multiple crossings. However, the key here is that by using Jesus's ability to walk back, we avoid having to send a missionary and cannibal back in the boat, thus saving a step.

In the standard solution, step6 is a missionary and cannibal returning, which we replace with Jesus walking back, thus saving that boat trip.

So the adapted solution would be:

1. C1 and C2 cross.

2. C1 returns.

3. C1 and C3 cross.

4. C1 returns.

5. M1 and M2 cross.

6. M1 (Jesus) walks back.

7. M1 and C1 cross.

8. C1 returns.

9. M3 and C1 cross.

This totals 9 steps. But maybe there's a shorter version.

Alternatively, after step5: M1 and M2 cross to Bank2. Then Bank1 has M3 and C1. Bank2 has M1, M2, C2, C3. Then, instead of having M1 walk back, use the boat to send C2 back.

But that would leave Bank2 with M1, M2, C3. C2 returns to Bank1, making Bank1 have M3, C1, C2. Which is 1M and 2C. Bad.

Alternatively, send M2 back. Then Bank2 has M1, C2, C3. Bank1 has M2, M3, C1. Which is 2M and1C. Safe. Then, boat takes M2 and M3 to Bank2. But that leaves C1 on Bank1. Then send C1 over. But this is similar to the standard solution.

By using Jesus's ability to walk back, we save a boat trip. So the solution above with 9 steps is valid, but I wonder if there's a more optimal one.

However, the problem states that Jesus can walk across by walking on water. So perhaps we can use this to our advantage in a different way.

Another Idea:

Use Jesus to be on Bank2 early to ensure that when cannibals are there, they don't outnumber missionaries.

Step1: Boat takes C1 and C2 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C3; Boat at Bank2

Step2: Jesus walks to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3, C3; Bank2: M1, C1, C2

But Bank2 has 1M and 2C. Not safe. Can't do.

Step2 alternative: Boat returns with C1.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3, C1, C3; Boat at Bank1

Bank2: C2

Step3: Boat takes C1 and C3 to Bank2.

Bank1: M1, M2, M3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: C1, C2, C3

Step4: Jesus walks to Bank2.

Bank1: M2, M3; Bank2: M1, C1, C2, C3

Bank1:2M. Safe. Bank2:1M,3C. Not safe.

No good.

Another Idea: Use the boat to take two missionaries, then have Jesus walk back.

Step1: Boat takes M1 and M2 to Bank2.

Bank1: M3, C1, C2, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M1, M2

Step2: Jesus walks back to Bank1.

Bank1: M1, M3, C1, C2, C3; Boat at Bank2

Bank2: M2

Bank1:2M,3C. Not safe.

No good.

Final Attempt:

Maybe the optimal solution involves Jesus walking over once to balance the counts, allowing fewer steps.

Here's a possible plan:

1. Boat takes C1 and C2 to Bank2.

Bank1: 3M,1C; Bank2:0M,2C.

2. Boat returns with C1.

Bank1:3M,2C; Bank2:0M,1C.

3. Boat takes C1 and C3 to Bank2.

Bank1:3M; Bank2:0M,3C.

4. Boat returns with C1.

Bank1:3M,1C; Bank2:0M,2C.

5. Boat takes M1 and M2 to Bank2.

Bank1:1M,1C; Bank2:2M,2C.

6. M1 (Jesus) walks back to Bank1.

Bank1:2M,1C; Bank2:1M,2C.

7. Boat takes M1 and M3 to Bank2.

Bank1:0M,1C; Bank2:3M,2C.

8. Boat returns with C1.

Bank1:0M,2C; Bank2:3M,1C.

9. Boat takes C1 and C2 to Bank2.

Bank1:0M,0C; Bank2:3M,3C.

But steps 7-9 have issues. After step5: Bank1 has M3 and C1. Bank2 has M1, M2, C2. Then step6: M1 walks back to Bank1, making Bank1 have M1, M3, C1. Bank2 has M2, C2. Bank1:2M,1C. Safe. Bank2:1M,1C. Safe.

Step7: Boat takes M1 and C1 to Bank2. Bank1: M3. Bank2: M1, M2, C1, C2.

Bank1:1M. Safe. Bank2:2M,2C. Safe.

Step8: Boat returns with C1. Bank1: M3, C1. Bank2: M1, M2, C2.

Step9: Boat takes M3 and C1 to Bank2. All safe.

This works. So the steps are:

1. C1 and C2 cross.

2. C1 returns.

3. C1 and C3 cross.

4. C1 returns.

5. M1 and M2 cross.

6. M1 walks back.

7. M1 and C1 cross.

8. C1 returns.

9. M3 and C1 cross.

This uses Jesus's ability in step6 to walk back, saving a boat trip. Thus, it's a valid plan.

But to check if all steps are safe:

Step1: Bank2 has 0M,2C. Safe. Bank1:3M,1C. Safe.

Step2: Bank1:3M,2C. Safe. Bank2:0M,1C. Safe.

Step3: Bank1:3M. Safe. Bank2:0M,3C. Safe.

Step4: Bank1:3M,1C. Safe. Bank2:0M,2C. Safe.

Step5: Bank1:1M,1C. Safe. Bank2:2M,2C. Safe.

Step6: M1 walks back. Bank1:2M,1C. Safe. Bank2:1M,2C. Safe.

Step7: Boat takes M1 and C1. Bank1:1M. Safe. Bank2:2M,2C. Safe.

Step8: C1 returns. Bank1:1M,1C. Safe. Bank2:2M,1C. Safe.

Step9: M3 and C1 cross. Bank1:0M,0C. Bank2:3M,3C. Safe.

Yes, all steps are safe. And the boat is never over capacity.

So this plan works, utilizing Jesus's ability to walk back once, thus saving a boat trip that would otherwise require a missionary and cannibal to return.

To solve the problem, we utilize Jesus's ability to walk across the river, allowing us to adjust missionary counts without additional boat trips. Here's the step-by-step plan:

Two cannibals cross to Bank2.

Boat: C1, C2 → Bank2

Bank1: 3M, 1C (M1, M2, M3, C3)

Bank2: 0M, 2C (C1, C2)

One cannibal returns with the boat.

Boat: C1 ←

Bank1: 3M, 2C (M1, M2, M3, C1, C3)

Bank2: 0M, 1C (C2)

Two cannibals cross again.

Boat: C1, C3 → Bank2

Bank1: 3M (M1, M2, M3)

Bank2: 0M, 3C (C1, C2, C3)

One cannibal returns.

Boat: C1 ←

Bank1: 3M, 1C (M1, M2, M3, C1)

Bank2: 0M, 2C (C2, C3)

Two missionaries cross to Bank2.

Boat: M1, M2 → Bank2

Bank1: 1M, 1C (M3, C1)

Bank2: 2M, 2C (M1, M2, C2, C3)

Jesus (M1) walks back to Bank1.

Bank1: 2M, 1C (M1, M3, C1)

Bank2: 1M, 2C (M2, C2, C3)

Jesus and the remaining cannibal cross to Bank2.

Boat: M1, C1 → Bank2

Bank1: 1M (M3)

Bank2: 2M, 3C (M1, M2, C1, C2, C3)

One cannibal returns to retrieve the last missionary.

Boat: C1 ←

Bank1: 1M, 1C (M3, C1)

Bank2: 2M, 2C (M1, M2, C2, C3)

The last missionary and cannibal cross to Bank2.

Boat: M3, C1 → Bank2

Bank1: Empty

Bank2: 3M, 3C (All safely arrived)

Final Answer:
The plan involves a sequence of boat trips and Jesus walking to ensure all cross safely. Key steps include strategically moving cannibals, using Jesus to balance counts, and finalizing the crossings. The steps are:

Send two cannibals over, return one.

Send two cannibals again, return one.

Send two missionaries, Jesus walks back.

Jesus and a cannibal cross, retrieve the last missionary.

All missionaries and cannibals reach Bank2 safely. The solution is encapsulated as:

[M1 and C1 cross] → [M1 walks back] → [M3 and C1 cross] → [C1 returns] → [C1 and C2 cross] → [C1 returns] → [C1 and C3 cross] → [C1 returns] → [M1 and M2 cross] → [M1 walks back] → [M1 and C1 cross] → [C1 returns] → [M3 and C1 cross]
[M1 and C1 cross] → [M1 walks back] → [M3 and C1 cross] → [C1 returns] → [C1 and C2 cross] → [C1 returns] → [C1 and C3 cross] → [C1 returns] → [M1 and M2 cross] → [M1 walks back] → [M1 and C1 cross] → [C1 returns] → [M3 and C1 cross]
