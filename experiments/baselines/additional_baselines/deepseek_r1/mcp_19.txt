There are five types of things: vessel, location, group, set, and integer.

Problem Description:
Consider the following. Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. The problem just described is doubled to have two separate occurrences at once, which don't interact with each other. That is, there are two sets, each with their respective set of three missionaries and three cannibals, a boat, and so on.

Instance:
boat1 is a vessel vessels. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

For each set, three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1, the boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2 for both sets.
Okay, so I need to solve this doubled missionaries and cannibals problem. Let me first recall the original problem. In the classic version, you have three missionaries and three cannibals on one bank, a boat that can hold up to two people. The goal is to get everyone across without ever having the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank or in the boat. Now, this problem says it's doubled, meaning there are two separate sets. Each set has three missionaries, three cannibals, a boat, and their own banks. They don't interact, so I have to solve both independently but at the same time. Hmm, but how does that work? Wait, maybe the actions for each set can be done in parallel. But I have to come up with a plan where steps for both sets are interleaved or done together. Let me think.

First, let me tackle one set to remember the solution. The classic solution involves several crossings. For example:

1. Two cannibals cross to the other bank.

2. One returns.

3. Two cannibals cross again.

4. One returns.

5. Two missionaries cross.

6. A missionary and a cannibal return.

7. Two missionaries cross again.

8. One cannibal returns.

9. Two cannibals cross.

10. One cannibal returns.

11. Two cannibals cross.

Wait, but maybe there's a more efficient way. Let me check. Oh right, the standard solution requires 11 steps. But perhaps in this case, since there are two independent sets, the plan would involve steps where each action is for one set, but the other set can act in parallel. So maybe each set does their own crossings, and the total steps would be the same as solving one set, but with actions from both sets interleaved. But the problem says "Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2 for both sets." So the plan needs to handle both sets, but since they don't interact, perhaps the steps for each set can be done in any order relative to each other, as long as each set's steps are in the right sequence.

Wait, but the problem might require that the steps for both sets are combined into a single plan. For example, step 1: set1 sends two cannibals across. Step 2: set2 sends two cannibals across. Step 3: set1 sends one back. Step 4: set2 sends one back. Etc. So the total number of steps would be similar to solving one set, but with each step involving both sets. But actually, since they are independent, maybe each action can be for either set. So the plan would be a sequence of actions where each action is for one of the two sets, but the order has to make sure that both sets eventually complete their crossings. Alternatively, maybe the steps can be done in parallel where possible. But the problem probably expects a sequence of actions, each action being for one of the sets, such that both are solved.

So the approach would be to first solve set1, then set2, but that's inefficient. Alternatively, interleave their steps. Let me think. Since the two sets are independent, perhaps the plan can alternate steps between the two sets, but each set's sequence must follow the correct order. So for each set, you have their 11 steps, but interleaving them. However, that would result in 22 steps. But maybe there's a smarter way where some steps can be combined. Wait, but the problem says "the problem just described is doubled to have two separate occurrences at once, which don't interact with each other." So perhaps each action in the plan can involve either set1 or set2, but they don't interfere. Therefore, the plan can be a sequence of actions where each action is for one set, and the order of actions for each set must follow their own valid sequence. So the total plan is a merging of the two individual plans, such that the order of actions for each set is preserved. So for example, if set1's plan is steps A1, A2, ..., A11, and set2's plan is steps B1, B2, ..., B11, then the combined plan could be interleaving these steps in any order as long as A1 comes before A2, etc., and B1 before B2, etc. But since the two sets are independent, their steps can be interleaved in any way. However, the problem might require a minimal number of steps. If we can perform actions for both sets in parallel where possible, but the problem might not allow parallel actions. Wait, the problem says "Find a plan" which is a sequence of actions. Each action is for a single set. Therefore, the minimal plan would be the same as solving each set in parallel, but since they can't interfere, the total number of steps would be the maximum of the two individual steps. Wait, no, because each step is for one set. For example, if set1 takes 11 steps and set2 also takes 11 steps, then if you interleave them, the total steps would be 11*2=22. But maybe you can do better. Wait, but in the original problem, each step is moving people from one bank to the other. But in the doubled problem, each step can be for either set. So perhaps the total number of steps is 11, because each step can handle both sets simultaneously. Wait, but the boat's capacity is 2 per set. So each set's boat can carry up to two people. If the problem allows moving both sets' boats in the same step, but since they are separate, maybe each step is an action for one set. So each step is either moving people in set1's boat or set2's boat. Therefore, the total steps would be 11 steps for each set, so 22 steps if done sequentially, but perhaps fewer if some steps can be interleaved without conflict. Wait, but how? The original problem requires 11 steps. For two independent sets, each needing 11 steps, but since their actions are separate, you can interleave them. For example, step 1: set1 moves two cannibals. Step 2: set2 moves two cannibals. Step3: set1 moves one back. Step4: set2 moves one back. Etc. So in this way, each set's plan is executed in parallel, leading to a total of 11 steps, because each step for set1 is alternated with set2. Wait, but no. Because each set requires 11 steps. If you alternate, then after 11 steps for each, that's 22 steps. But maybe some steps can be done in parallel. But the problem statement doesn't mention whether actions can be done in parallel. Since the original problem requires a sequence of boat trips, each moving people from one bank to the other, the doubled problem would require each action to be for one set or the other. Therefore, the minimal plan would have 11 steps per set, but interleaved, totaling 22 steps. However, perhaps there's a way to optimize. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the problem expects that since the two sets are independent, the plan can handle both by just doing the same steps for each set. But each step would involve both sets. For example, in step 1, both set1 and set2 send two cannibals across. But since the boats are separate, maybe that's allowed. But the problem says the boat's capacity is 2. Each boat can carry at most two people. So for each set, the boat can carry two people. If the problem allows both boats to move in the same step, then each step can have actions for both sets. But the problem statement says "the boat's capacity is 2". It doesn't mention whether multiple boats can move at once. The original problem has one boat; here, each set has its own boat. So in the doubled problem, each set's boat can be operated independently. Therefore, perhaps in each step, you can move both boats, each carrying people according to their own rules. But the problem's instance mentions boat1 is a vessel, but perhaps there's a boat2 as well. Wait, the instance description says "boat1 is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. ... For each set, three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1, the boat is at location bank1." Wait, but the instance mentions boat1, but there must be boat2 for the second set. Maybe the problem statement implies that each set has its own boat. So for each set, the boat starts at bank1. Therefore, in each step, you can choose which boat to move. So each action is moving a boat (either boat1 or boat2) with some people from one bank to the other. The key is that the two sets are entirely separate, so moving boat1 doesn't affect the state of set2, and vice versa.

Therefore, the plan can be structured as a sequence of moves, each move being for either set1 or set2. To minimize the total number of steps, you can interleave the moves of the two sets so that both are making progress. The total number of steps would be the maximum of the two individual step counts if they can be perfectly interleaved. For example, if each set requires 11 moves, and you alternate between them, the total would be 11*2=22. However, if one set's moves can be interleaved with the other's without waiting, maybe it can be done in 11 steps where each step involves both sets moving. But the problem likely expects that each move is for a single boat, so you can't move both boats in the same step. Therefore, the minimal plan would require 11 steps for each set, totaling 22 steps, but interleaved. Alternatively, perhaps some steps can be combined. Wait, let's think about the original solution steps. Let's take the standard solution for one set:

1. Send two cannibals to the other side.

2. Send one cannibal back.

3. Send two cannibals again.

4. Send one cannibal back.

5. Send two missionaries.

6. Send one missionary and one cannibal back.

7. Send two missionaries.

8. Send one cannibal back.

9. Send two cannibals.

10. Send one cannibal back.

11. Send two cannibals.

Wait, that's 11 steps. Alternatively, different sequences can be used. Let me check another solution. Another approach is:

1. C and C cross to right.

2. C returns.

3. C and C cross.

4. C returns.

5. M and M cross.

6. M and C return.

7. M and M cross.

8. C returns.

9. C and C cross.

10. C returns.

11. C and C cross.

Yes, that's 11 steps. Now, if we have two sets, each needing to perform these 11 steps, but we can interleave the steps. So for example, step 1: set1 sends two Cs. Step 2: set2 sends two Cs. Step3: set1 sends one back. Step4: set2 sends one back. Etc. This would take 22 steps. Alternatively, if we can perform steps for both sets in the same move, but the problem states that the two sets don't interact. However, the problem's instance mentions "boat1" as a vessel, but maybe each set has their own boat (boat1 and boat2). If the problem allows moving both boats in the same step, then each step could involve both sets moving. For example, step1: set1 moves two Cs, set2 moves two Cs. But the problem might require that each step is a single action (moving one boat). The problem description says "the boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it." So each boat movement must have at least one person. Therefore, each step must involve moving one boat with some people. Therefore, the plan would have to be a sequence of steps where each step is moving either boat1 or boat2, each time carrying 1 or 2 people, adhering to the constraints for that set.

So the minimal plan would require 11 steps per set, totaling 22 steps, but interleaved. However, perhaps some steps can be optimized. Let me think: for example, if set1 and set2 are both at the same stage, maybe their steps can be alternated without conflict. Let's outline the steps for both sets:

Set1 Steps:

1. C1 and C2 cross to bank2.

2. C1 returns to bank1.

3. C3 and C4 cross to bank2. (Wait, but each set has three cannibals. Wait, original problem is three missionaries and three cannibals. So each set has three cannibals and three missionaries. So step 1: two cannibals cross. Then one returns, etc.

Wait, perhaps I need to outline the exact steps for each set.

For Set1 (and similarly for Set2):

Initial state: bank1 has 3M, 3C, boat. bank2 has 0.

Step 1: Boat takes 2C to bank2. Now bank1: 3M,1C; bank2: 0M,2C.

Step 2: Boat returns with 1C. Now bank1:3M,2C; bank2:0M,1C.

Step3: Boat takes 2C to bank2. Now bank1:3M,0C; bank2:0M,3C.

Step4: Boat returns with 1C. Now bank1:3M,1C; bank2:0M,2C.

Step5: Boat takes 2M to bank2. Now bank1:1M,1C; bank2:2M,2C.

Step6: Boat returns with 1M and 1C. Now bank1:2M,2C; bank2:1M,1C.

Step7: Boat takes 2M to bank2. Now bank1:0M,2C; bank2:3M,1C.

Step8: Boat returns with 1C. Now bank1:0M,3C; bank2:3M,0C.

Step9: Boat takes 2C to bank2. Now bank1:0M,1C; bank2:3M,2C.

Step10: Boat returns with 1C. Now bank1:0M,2C; bank2:3M,1C.

Step11: Boat takes 2C to bank2. All on bank2: 3M,3C.

Wait, but this seems to take 11 steps. However, in step 8, after returning with 1C, bank1 has 0M,3C? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.

Original solution steps for one set:

1. Two cannibals cross.

2. One returns.

3. Two cannibals cross again.

4. One returns.

5. Two missionaries cross.

6. One missionary and one cannibal return.

7. Two missionaries cross.

8. One cannibal returns.

9. Two cannibals cross.

10. One cannibal returns.

11. Two cannibals cross.

Yes, that's 11 steps. So applying this to set1 and set2, each needing 11 steps. Now, if we can interleave the steps for set1 and set2, the total number of steps would be 22. However, perhaps some steps can be done in parallel. For example, when set1 is moving two cannibals over, set2 can also move two cannibals over in the same step. But the problem says that each action is moving a boat from one bank to the other, carrying people. So each step is for one boat only. Therefore, you can't move both boats in the same step. Therefore, each step is either moving set1's boat or set2's boat. Therefore, the minimal plan would be 22 steps, alternating between set1 and set2.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize. Let me see. For example, steps where a single person returns can be interleaved with steps where two cross. Maybe the order can be arranged to minimize the total steps, but I think each set needs 11 steps regardless. Therefore, the total steps would be 22.

However, the problem might accept a plan where the steps for both sets are listed in sequence, first solving set1 then set2. But that would be 22 steps, which is correct but not optimized. Alternatively, interleave them to show that they can be done in parallel. But since each step is for one set, the total is 22.

But wait, perhaps the problem allows combining steps. For example, if both sets are moving two cannibals in the same step, but since they are separate, maybe that's allowed. However, the problem's description says "the boat's capacity is 2". Each boat can carry at most two. So each boat can carry up to two of their own set's people. Therefore, in one step, boat1 can carry two from set1, and boat2 can carry two from set2. But the problem states that each step is a single action. The problem might require that each step is a single boat movement. Therefore, the answer must list each boat movement separately, either for set1 or set2.

Therefore, the plan will have 22 steps, alternating between set1 and set2's steps. For example:

1. Set1: Two cannibals cross to bank2.

2. Set2: Two cannibals cross to bank2.

3. Set1: One cannibal returns to bank1.

4. Set2: One cannibal returns to bank1.

5. Set1: Two cannibals cross to bank2.

6. Set2: Two cannibals cross to bank2.

7. Set1: One cannibal returns to bank1.

8. Set2: One cannibal returns to bank1.

9. Set1: Two missionaries cross to bank2.

10. Set2: Two missionaries cross to bank2.

11. Set1: One missionary and one cannibal return to bank1.

12. Set2: One missionary and one cannibal return to bank1.

13. Set1: Two missionaries cross to bank2.

14. Set2: Two missionaries cross to bank2.

15. Set1: One cannibal returns to bank1.

16. Set2: One cannibal returns to bank1.

17. Set1: Two cannibals cross to bank2.

18. Set2: Two cannibals cross to bank2.

19. Set1: One cannibal returns to bank1.

20. Set2: One cannibal returns to bank1.

21. Set1: Two cannibals cross to bank2.

22. Set2: Two cannibals cross to bank2.

But wait, this would work only if each step is for one set. However, when alternating, we need to ensure that each set's sequence is preserved. For example, after step1 (set1's two cannibals cross), step2 is set2's two cannibals cross. Then step3 is set1's return, etc. However, when we alternate like this, each set's steps are interleaved, but the sequence for each set is maintained. This would work, and the total steps are 22. However, I need to verify that this interleaving doesn't violate any constraints. For example, after set1's step1, set1's bank1 has 3M,1C and bank2 has 0M,2C. Then set2's step1: send two cannibals, so set2's bank1 now has 3M,1C, bank2 has 0M,2C. Then set1's step2: one cannibal returns, so set1's bank1 becomes 3M,2C, bank2 0M,1C. Then set2's step2: one cannibal returns, set2's bank1 becomes 3M,2C, bank2 0M,1C. This seems okay. Continuing this way, each set's state progresses independently. So this plan would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows a more optimal solution by interleaving steps where possible. For example, when one set is sending people over, the other set can also send people without conflict. However, since each set is independent, their actions don't interfere, so this should be possible. Therefore, the minimal number of steps would be 11, with each step involving both sets moving their boats simultaneously. But the problem's description might not allow this, as each step is a single boat movement. The problem says "Find a plan", and plans are typically sequences of actions. Each action is moving one boat. Therefore, the answer is 22 steps, alternating between set1 and set2.

But wait, perhaps there's a way to do it in 11 steps by moving both sets' boats in each step. For example, each step involves both sets moving their boats. But the problem's original constraint is that the boat cannot cross with nothing on it, but since each boat is separate, they can both be moving. However, the problem might not allow this, as each action is moving one boat. The problem's instance mentions boat1, but not boat2. Wait, the instance says "For each set, three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1, the boat is at location bank1." So each set has its own boat. Therefore, boat1 belongs to set1, and boat2 (implied) belongs to set2. Therefore, each step can involve either boat1 or boat2 moving. Therefore, the minimal number of steps would be 11, because each step can handle both boats moving in parallel. But the problem might not allow that, as each step is a single vessel movement. The problem description doesn't specify whether multiple boats can move in one step, but traditionally, in planning problems, each action is a single operation. Therefore, the answer must be 22 steps, each step moving one boat from either set.

But I need to confirm this. Let me check the problem statement again: "Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2 for both sets." The plan is a sequence of actions where each action is moving a boat (either boat1 or boat2) with some people. Each action must adhere to the constraints for that set. Since the sets are independent, the order of moving boat1 and boat2 can be interleaved. Therefore, the plan can alternate between the two sets, leading to 22 steps.

However, perhaps there's a way to merge the steps. For example, if both sets can perform the same action in the same step, but since they're independent, maybe we can represent both actions as a single step. But in planning, typically each step is a single action. Therefore, the correct approach is to list each boat movement separately, leading to 22 steps.

But wait, let me think differently. Suppose we treat each set's problem as separate and solve them in parallel. Then, for each step in the original solution, both sets perform that step. For example, step 1: both set1 and set2 move two cannibals. But since each boat is separate, this is allowed. However, the problem states that the boat cannot cross with nothing on it, which is satisfied here. However, the problem might require that each step is a single boat movement. If that's the case, then we can't move both boats in one step. Therefore, each step must be for one set or the other.

In that case, the minimal plan would have 22 steps. However, perhaps the problem allows grouping steps where possible. For example, in the first step, move two cannibals from set1 and two from set2. But since each boat is separate, maybe this is allowed as a single step. However, in standard planning formalisms, each action is a single operation. Therefore, the answer likely expects 22 steps, each for one set.

But the problem might have a different approach. Let me think again about the original problem's solution. The key is that after certain steps, you can have a state where a return trip is needed, which can be interleaved with the other set's trips. Maybe by interleaving, the total number of steps can be reduced. For example, when one set sends two people over and another sends two, then their returns can be combined. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved in 11 steps by handling both sets simultaneously in each step. For example, each step involves both sets moving their boats with the same number of people. For instance:

Step1: Set1 and Set2 each move two cannibals to bank2.

Step2: Set1 and Set2 each return one cannibal.

Step3: Set1 and Set2 each move two cannibals again.

... and so on.

But this assumes that both sets can perform their actions in the same step, which might not be allowed if each step is a single action. The problem's description doesn't clarify this, but since the problem mentions "two separate occurrences at once, which don't interact with each other," it might allow parallel actions. If that's the case, then the plan can have 11 steps, each step involving both sets performing the same action. However, this depends on the problem's allowed actions. If parallel actions are allowed, then this would work. Otherwise, if each step is a single boat movement, then 22 steps.

But the problem's instance mentions "boat1" but not boat2. Wait, the instance says "For each set..." which implies that each set has its own boat. So there must be boat1 and boat2. Therefore, each step can involve moving either boat1 or boat2. Therefore, the total number of steps is 22. However, the problem might accept a plan where both sets are handled in parallel, with each step involving both boats moving. But this is unclear.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest answer is to provide the 22-step plan, alternating between set1 and set2. However, the problem might expect that since the sets are independent, the solution is the same as solving each separately, and thus the plan is just the concatenation of both plans. But that would be 22 steps. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the two sets can be solved in parallel, leading to 11 steps where each step involves both sets moving their boats. For example:

Step 1: Set1 moves two C to bank2. Set2 moves two C to bank2.

Step 2: Set1 returns one C. Set2 returns one C.

... etc.

But this requires that each step involves multiple actions, which might not be allowed. The problem's description doesn't specify whether actions can be parallel. In standard planning, usually, each step is a single action. Therefore, the answer must be 22 steps.

But to confirm, let's outline the first few steps:

1. Set1: Boat1 takes 2 C from bank1 to bank2.

2. Set2: Boat2 takes 2 C from bank1 to bank2.

3. Set1: Boat1 takes 1 C from bank2 to bank1.

4. Set2: Boat2 takes 1 C from bank2 to bank1.

5. Set1: Boat1 takes 2 C from bank1 to bank2.

6. Set2: Boat2 takes 2 C from bank1 to bank2.

7. Set1: Boat1 takes 1 C from bank2 to bank1.

8. Set2: Boat2 takes 1 C from bank2 to bank1.

9. Set1: Boat1 takes 2 M from bank1 to bank2.

10. Set2: Boat2 takes 2 M from bank1 to bank2.

11. Set1: Boat1 takes 1 M and 1 C from bank2 to bank1.

12. Set2: Boat2 takes 1 M and 1 C from bank2 to bank1.

13. Set1: Boat1 takes 2 M from bank1 to bank2.

14. Set2: Boat2 takes 2 M from bank1 to bank2.

15. Set1: Boat1 takes 1 C from bank2 to bank1.

16. Set2: Boat2 takes 1 C from bank2 to bank1.

17. Set1: Boat1 takes 2 C from bank1 to bank2.

18. Set2: Boat2 takes 2 C from bank1 to bank2.

19. Set1: Boat1 takes 1 C from bank2 to bank1.

20. Set2: Boat2 takes 1 C from bank2 to bank1.

21. Set1: Boat1 takes 2 C from bank1 to bank2.

22. Set2: Boat2 takes 2 C from bank1 to bank2.

After these 22 steps, both sets should have all missionaries and cannibals on bank2. Each set's steps follow the original solution, just interleaved. This should work. However, to ensure correctness, let's check one set's progression:

For Set1:

Step1: 2 C to bank2. (bank1: 3M,1C; bank2: 0M,2C)

Step3: 1 C returns. (bank1:3M,2C; bank2:0M,1C)

Step5: 2 C to bank2. (bank1:3M,0C; bank2:0M,3C)

Step7: 1 C returns. (bank1:3M,1C; bank2:0M,2C)

Step9: 2 M to bank2. (bank1:1M,1C; bank2:2M,2C)

Step11: 1 M and 1 C return. (bank1:2M,2C; bank2:1M,1C)

Step13: 2 M to bank2. (bank1:0M,2C; bank2:3M,1C)

Step15: 1 C returns. (bank1:0M,3C; bank2:3M,0C)

Step17: 2 C to bank2. (bank1:0M,1C; bank2:3M,2C)

Step19: 1 C returns. (bank1:0M,2C; bank2:3M,1C)

Step21: 2 C to bank2. (bank1:0M,0C; bank2:3M,3C)

Yes, that works for set1. Similarly for set2, their steps are even-numbered steps doing the same. So this plan is valid.

Therefore, the answer is a plan with 22 steps, alternating between set1 and set2's moves.

To solve the doubled missionaries and cannibals problem, we handle each set independently, alternating their moves. Each set requires 11 steps, leading to a total of 22 steps. Here's the plan:

Set1: Boat1 transports 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

Set2: Boat2 transports 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

Set1: Boat1 returns 1 cannibal to bank1.

Set2: Boat2 returns 1 cannibal to bank1.

Set1: Boat1 transports 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

Set2: Boat2 transports 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

Set1: Boat1 returns 1 cannibal to bank1.

Set2: Boat2 returns 1 cannibal to bank1.

Set1: Boat1 transports 2 missionaries from bank1 to bank2.

Set2: Boat2 transports 2 missionaries from bank1 to bank2.

Set1: Boat1 returns 1 missionary and 1 cannibal to bank1.

Set2: Boat2 returns 1 missionary and 1 cannibal to bank1.

Set1: Boat1 transports 2 missionaries from bank1 to bank2.

Set2: Boat2 transports 2 missionaries from bank1 to bank2.

Set1: Boat1 returns 1 cannibal to bank1.

Set2: Boat2 returns 1 cannibal to bank1.

Set1: Boat1 transports 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

Set2: Boat2 transports 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

Set1: Boat1 returns 1 cannibal to bank1.

Set2: Boat2 returns 1 cannibal to bank1.

Set1: Boat1 transports 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

Set2: Boat2 transports 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

Verification:

Each set's missionaries and cannibals cross without ever being outnumbered on either bank or in the boat.

Steps alternate between the two sets, ensuring both progress independently.

All end up on bank2 for both sets.

Answer:
The plan involves 22 steps where each set's boat alternates moves, ensuring both sets of missionaries and cannibals safely reach bank2.
