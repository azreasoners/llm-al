There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.



Problem Description:

Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. Three missionaries alone with a cannibal can convert him into a missionary.Â 



Instance:

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.



Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.



Here's a solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, considering the added rule about conversion:

Initial State:

Bank 1: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat
Bank 2: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
Moves (M = Missionary, C = Cannibal):

Bank 1 to Bank 2: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal (Bank 1: 2M, 2C; Bank 2: 1M, 1C)
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 Missionary (Bank 1: 3M, 2C; Bank 2: 0M, 1C)
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 Cannibals (Bank 1: 3M, 0C; Bank 2: 0M, 3C)
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 Cannibal (Bank 1: 3M, 1C; Bank 2: 0M, 2C)
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 Missionaries (Bank 1: 1M, 1C; Bank 2: 2M, 2C)
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal (Bank 1: 2M, 2C; Bank 2: 1M, 1C)
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 Missionaries (Bank 1: 0M, 2C; Bank 2: 3M, 2C)
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 Cannibal (Bank 1: 0M, 3C; Bank 2: 3M, 1C)
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 Cannibals (Bank 1: 0M, 1C; Bank 2: 3M, 3C)
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 Cannibal (Bank 1: 0M, 2C; Bank 2: 3M, 2C)
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal (Bank 1: 1M, 1C; Bank 2: 2M, 2C)
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 Missionary (Bank 1: 2M, 1C; Bank 2: 1M, 2C)
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 Missionaries (Bank 1: 0M, 1C; Bank 2: 3M, 2C)
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 Cannibal (Bank 1: 0M, 2C; Bank 2: 3M, 1C)
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 Cannibals (Bank 1: 0M, 0C; Bank 2: 3M, 3C)
Final State:

Bank 1: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
Bank 2: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals
This solution adheres to all the rules:

The boat never travels empty.
Cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
All missionaries and cannibals are successfully transported to Bank 2.
The conversion rule is not needed to solve this classic version of the puzzle. It only becomes relevant if you have a larger number of missionaries/cannibals, or different boat capacities.
Let me know if you'd like to explore variations of this problem with different numbers or boat sizes!
