Problem Description:

Four missionaries and four cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2.



boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.



Four missionaries and four cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.Â 



Here's a step-by-step solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem:

Initial State:

Bank 1: 4 Missionaries, 4 Cannibals, Boat

Moves:

Two Cannibals cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2:

Bank 1: 4 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals
Bank 2: 0 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals, Boat
One Cannibal returns from Bank 2 to Bank 1:

Bank 1: 4 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat
Bank 2: 0 Missionaries, 1 Cannibal
Two Cannibals cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2:

Bank 1: 4 Missionaries, 1 Cannibal
Bank 2: 0 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat
One Cannibal returns from Bank 2 to Bank 1:

Bank 1: 4 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals, Boat
Bank 2: 0 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals
Two Missionaries cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2:

Bank 1: 2 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals
Bank 2: 2 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals, Boat
One Missionary and One Cannibal return from Bank 2 to Bank 1:

Bank 1: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat
Bank 2: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal
Two Missionaries cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2:

Bank 1: 1 Missionary, 3 Cannibals
Bank 2: 3 Missionaries, 1 Cannibal, Boat
One Cannibal returns from Bank 2 to Bank 1:

Bank 1: 1 Missionary, 4 Cannibals, Boat
Bank 2: 3 Missionaries
Two Cannibals cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2:

Bank 1: 1 Missionary, 2 Cannibals
Bank 2: 3 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals, Boat
One Cannibal returns from Bank 2 to Bank 1:

Bank 1: 1 Missionary, 3 Cannibals, Boat
Bank 2: 3 Missionaries, 1 Cannibal
Two Missionaries cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2:

Bank 1: 0 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals
Bank 2: 4 Missionaries, 1 Cannibal, Boat
One Cannibal returns from Bank 2 to Bank 1:

Bank 1: 0 Missionaries, 4 Cannibals, Boat
Bank 2: 4 Missionaries
Two Cannibals cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2:

Bank 1: 0 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals
Bank 2: 4 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals, Boat
One Cannibal returns from Bank 2 to Bank 1:

Bank 1: 0 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat
Bank 2: 4 Missionaries, 1 Cannibal
Two Cannibals cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2:

Bank 1: 0 Missionaries, 1 Cannibal
Bank 2: 4 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat
One Cannibal returns from Bank 2 to Bank 1:

Bank 1: 0 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals, Boat
Bank 2: 4 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals
Final two cannibals cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2:

Bank 1: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
Bank 2: 4 Missionaries, 4 Cannibals, Boat
This sequence of moves ensures that at no point do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
