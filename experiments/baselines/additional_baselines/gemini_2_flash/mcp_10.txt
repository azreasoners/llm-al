There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.



Problem Description:

Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. Additionally, one of the missionaries is Jesus, who can walk across by walking on the water.



This is a variation of the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem. The addition of Jesus being able to walk on water significantly simplifies the puzzle. Here's the solution:

Understanding the Constraints:

Boat Capacity: Maximum 2 people.
Safety Rule: Cannibals can never outnumber missionaries in any location (either riverbank or the boat).
Jesus's Ability: Jesus can cross the river without the boat.
Solution:

Jesus crosses the river by himself. (This immediately solves a large part of the problem, as one missionary is now safely on the other side.)

Two cannibals cross the river in the boat.

One cannibal returns the boat.

Two missionaries cross the river in the boat.

One missionary returns the boat.

Two cannibals cross the river in the boat.

One cannibal returns the boat.

The remaining two missionaries cross the river in the boat.

Now, all three missionaries (including Jesus) and all three cannibals are on the other side of the river, with no instance of cannibals outnumbering missionaries in any location.

Why this works:

Jesus crossing alone removes the immediate danger of being outnumbered.
By carefully managing the trips, we ensure that at no point do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either side of the river or in the boat.
Key takeaway: Jesus's ability to walk on water is the key to this simplified solution. It removes the need for complex back-and-forth trips to maintain a safe ratio.
