There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.



Problem Description:

Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2.



boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.



Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.Â 



Here's a step-by-step solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, using the specified object types:

Initial State:

bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
boat: at bank1
Moves (M = Missionary, C = Cannibal):

Move: 1C, 1M from bank1 to bank2

bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
boat: at bank2
Move: 1M from bank2 to bank1

bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
boat: at bank1
Move: 2C from bank1 to bank2

bank1: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
boat: at bank2
Move: 1C from bank2 to bank1

bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
boat: at bank1
Move: 2M from bank1 to bank2

bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
boat: at bank2
Move: 1M, 1C from bank2 to bank1

bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
boat: at bank1
Move: 2M from bank1 to bank2

bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
boat: at bank2
Move: 1C from bank2 to bank1

bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
boat: at bank1
Move: 2C from bank1 to bank2

bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
boat: at bank2
Move: 1C from bank2 to bank1

bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
boat: at bank1
Move: 2C from bank1 to bank2

bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
boat: at bank2
Final State:

bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
boat: at bank2
All missionaries and cannibals have successfully crossed the river.
