There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.



Problem Description:

Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. There is a large cannibal which cannot fit in the boat with another person.



Instance: 

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries, cannibals and big cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.



Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2. 



Here's a solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem with the added constraint of a large cannibal:

Initial State:

Bank 1: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals (1 Big Cannibal)
Bank 2: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
Boat: Empty, at Bank 1
Moves (M = Missionary, C = Cannibal, BC = Big Cannibal):

Bank 1 to Bank 2: 1 C, 1 BC

Bank 1: 3 M, 2 C
Bank 2: 0 M, 1 C, 1 BC
Boat: 1 C, 1 BC at Bank 2
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 C

Bank 1: 3 M, 3 C
Bank 2: 0 M, 1 BC
Boat: 1 C at Bank 1
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 C

Bank 1: 3 M, 1 C
Bank 2: 0 M, 3 C, 1 BC
Boat: 2 C at Bank 2
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 C

Bank 1: 3 M, 2 C
Bank 2: 0 M, 2 C, 1 BC
Boat: 1 C at Bank 1
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 M

Bank 1: 1 M, 2 C
Bank 2: 2 M, 2 C, 1 BC
Boat: 2 M at Bank 2
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 M, 1 C

Bank 1: 2 M, 3 C
Bank 2: 1 M, 1 C, 1 BC
Boat: 1 M, 1 C at Bank 1
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 M

Bank 1: 0 M, 3 C
Bank 2: 3 M, 1 C, 1 BC
Boat: 2 M at Bank 2
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 C

Bank 1: 0 M, 4 C
Bank 2: 3 M, 0 C, 1 BC
Boat: 1 C at Bank 1
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 C

Bank 1: 0 M, 2 C
Bank 2: 3 M, 2 C, 1 BC
Boat: 2 C at Bank 2
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 C

Bank 1: 0 M, 3 C
Bank 2: 3 M, 1 C, 1 BC
Boat: 1 C at Bank 1
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 1 BC, 1 C

Bank 1: 0 M, 2 C
Bank 2: 3 M, 2 C
Boat: 1 BC, 1 C at bank 2
Final State:

Bank 1: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
Bank 2: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals (1 Big Cannibal)
Boat: Empty, at Bank 2
This solution accounts for the large cannibal by ensuring they are always accompanied by another cannibal when traveling by boat. This prevents the large cannibal from being alone on either bank or the boat which would make the puzzle unsolvable.
