There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.



Problem Description:

Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a rowboat which carries at most two people at once. The rowboat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the rowboat or the missionaries will be eaten. The rowboat's capacity is 2.



rowboat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.



Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The rowboat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.Â 



Here's a step-by-step solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, using the provided terminology:

Initial State:

bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, rowboat
bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Moves (numbered for clarity):

Move 1: 2 cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.

bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals, rowboat
Move 2: 1 cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1.

bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals, rowboat
bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 3: 2 missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2.

bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals
bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal, rowboat
Move 4: 1 missionary and 1 cannibal return from bank2 to bank1.

bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals, rowboat
bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals
Move 5: 2 missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2.

bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals, rowboat
Move 6: 1 cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1.

bank1: 0 missionaries, 4 cannibals, rowboat
bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Move 7: 2 cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.

bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals, rowboat
Move 8: 1 cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1.

bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals, rowboat
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 9: 2 cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.

bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, rowboat
Final State:

bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, rowboat
All missionaries and cannibals have successfully crossed the river to bank2.
