There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.



Problem Description:

Five missionaries and five cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. Additionally, there is a bridge which can be used to cross two people at once. To use the bridge there must at least one person using it.



Instance: 

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.



Five missionaries and five cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2. 



Here's a solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem with the added bridge constraint. We'll use M for Missionaries, C for Cannibals, B for Boat, and Br for Bridge. The format will be (Bank1: M, C, B) --Action--> (Bank2: M, C, B).

Initial State: (Bank1: 5M, 5C, B) -- -- (Bank2: 0M, 0C, )

Here's a possible solution:

(Bank1: 5M, 5C, B) --Boat: 1M, 1C--> (Bank2: 1M, 1C, B)
(Bank1: 5M, 4C) --Boat: 1M--> (Bank2: 2M, 1C, B)
(Bank1: 3M, 4C) --Boat: 1M, 1C--> (Bank2: 3M, 2C, B)
(Bank1: 3M, 3C) --Boat: 2C--> (Bank2: 3M, 4C, B)
(Bank1: 3M, 1C) --Boat: 1C--> (Bank2: 3M, 2C, B)
(Bank1: 3M) --Boat: 2M--> (Bank2: 5M, 2C, B)
(Bank1: 1M) --Boat: 1M, 1C--> (Bank2: 2M, 3C, B)
(Bank1: 0M, 1C) --Boat: 1C--> (Bank2: 2M, 4C, B)
(Bank1: 0M) --Boat: 2C--> (Bank2: 2M, 6C, B). This is not allowed.
Let's try a different approach, prioritizing moving missionaries first:

(Bank1: 5M, 5C, B) --Boat: 2M --> (Bank2: 2M, 0C, B)
(Bank1: 3M, 5C) --Boat: 1M --> (Bank2: 3M, 0C, B)
(Bank1: 2M, 5C) --Boat: 2C --> (Bank2: 3M, 2C, B)
(Bank1: 2M, 3C) --Boat: 1M, 1C --> (Bank2: 4M, 3C, B)
(Bank1: 1M, 2C) --Boat: 2M --> (Bank2: 5M, 3C, B)
(Bank1: 0M, 2C) --Boat: 1C --> (Bank2: 5M, 4C, B)
(Bank1: 0M, 1C) --Boat: 2C --> (Bank2: 5M, 6C, B). This is not allowed.
It appears the bridge is not needed to solve this problem. The classic solution without the bridge is as follows:

Two cannibals cross. (Bank 2: 0M, 2C)
One cannibal returns. (Bank 2: 0M, 1C)
Two missionaries cross. (Bank 2: 2M, 1C)
One missionary and one cannibal return. (Bank 2: 1M, 0C)
Two missionaries cross. (Bank 2: 3M, 0C)
One cannibal returns. (Bank 2: 3M, 1C)
Two cannibals cross. (Bank 2: 3M, 3C)
One cannibal returns. (Bank 2: 3M, 2C)
Two missionaries cross. (Bank 2: 5M, 2C)
One cannibal returns. (Bank 2: 5M, 1C)
Two cannibals cross. (Bank 2: 5M, 3C)
One cannibal returns. (Bank 2: 5M, 2C)
The final two cannibals cross. (Bank 2: 5M, 5C)
Therefore, the addition of the bridge doesn't change the minimal solution, as the boat alone provides sufficient transport.
