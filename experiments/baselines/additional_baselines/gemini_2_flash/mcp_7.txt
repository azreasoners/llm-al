There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.



Problem Description:

Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. Missionaries cannot row.



boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.



Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.Â 



Here's a solution to the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem, expressed using your defined types:

Initial State:

boat: at bank1
bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Moves (expressed as who is in the boat crossing from one bank to the other):

Move 1: 2 cannibals (from bank1 to bank2)

boat: at bank2
bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 2: 1 cannibal (from bank2 to bank1)

boat: at bank1
bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 3: 2 cannibals (from bank1 to bank2)

boat: at bank2
bank1: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Move 4: 1 cannibal (from bank2 to bank1)

boat: at bank1
bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 5: 2 missionaries (from bank1 to bank2)

boat: at bank2
bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 6: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal (from bank2 to bank1)

boat: at bank1
bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
Move 7: 2 missionaries (from bank1 to bank2)

boat: at bank2
bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 8: 1 cannibal (from bank2 to bank1)

boat: at bank1
bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Move 9: 2 cannibals (from bank1 to bank2)

boat: at bank2
bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 10: 1 cannibal (from bank2 to bank1)

boat: at bank1
bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 11: 2 cannibals (from bank1 to bank2)

boat: at bank2
bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Final State:

boat: at bank2
bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
This sequence of moves ensures that at no point do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
