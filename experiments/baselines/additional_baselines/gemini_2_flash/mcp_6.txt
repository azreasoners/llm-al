There are five types of things: vessel, location, group, basicGroup, and integer.



Problem Description:

Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. Additionally, someone must row on the boat, and only one missionary and one cannibal can row.



boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are basicGroups. rowers is a basic group. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.



Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.Â 



Here's a step-by-step solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, adhering to the given constraints:

Initial State:

bank1: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat
bank2: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
Moves (M = Missionary, C = Cannibal):

bank1 to bank2: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal (1M, 1C)

bank1: 2M, 2C
bank2: 1M, 1C, Boat
bank2 to bank1: 1 Missionary (1M)

bank1: 3M, 2C, Boat
bank2: 0M, 1C
bank1 to bank2: 2 Cannibals (2C)

bank1: 3M, 0C
bank2: 0M, 3C, Boat
bank2 to bank1: 1 Cannibal (1C)

bank1: 3M, 1C, Boat
bank2: 0M, 2C
bank1 to bank2: 2 Missionaries (2M)

bank1: 1M, 1C
bank2: 2M, 2C, Boat
bank2 to bank1: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal (1M, 1C)

bank1: 2M, 2C, Boat
bank2: 1M, 1C
bank1 to bank2: 2 Missionaries (2M)

bank1: 0M, 2C
bank2: 3M, 1C, Boat
bank2 to bank1: 1 Cannibal (1C)

bank1: 0M, 3C, Boat
bank2: 3M, 0C
bank1 to bank2: 2 Cannibals (2C)

bank1: 0M, 1C
bank2: 3M, 2C, Boat
bank2 to bank1: 1 Cannibal (1C)

bank1: 0M, 2C, Boat
bank2: 3M, 1C
bank1 to bank2: 2 Cannibals (2C)

bank1: 0M, 0C
bank2: 3M, 3C, Boat
Final State:

bank1: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
bank2: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat
This sequence of moves ensures that at no point do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank or in the boat. It also adheres to the boat's capacity and the requirement that someone must row.
