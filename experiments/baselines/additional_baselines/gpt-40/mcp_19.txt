There are five types of things: vessel, location, group, set, and integer.

Problem Description:
Consider the following. Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. The problem just described is doubled to have two separate occurrences at once, which don't interact with each other. That is, there are two sets, each with their respective set of three missionaries and three cannibals, a boat, and so on.

Instance:
boat1 is a vessel vessels. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

For each set, three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1, the boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2 for both sets.

This problem is a classic example of a state-space search problem where we aim to systematically generate a sequence of states that moves from the initial configuration to the goal configuration while satisfying all constraints. The additional complexity here is that the problem has been "doubled," meaning we must handle two separate, non-interacting instances simultaneously.

Definitions
Objects and Types:

Vessel: boat1 and boat2
Locations: bank1, bank2
Groups: missionaries and cannibals for each set
Integers: Represent the count of missionaries and cannibals on each side or in the boat.
Initial State (for each set):

At bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, and the boat.
At bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals, and no boat.
Goal State (for each set):

At bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, and the boat.
At bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals.
Constraints:

Cannibals must never outnumber missionaries on any bank or in the boat.
The boat cannot cross empty.
The boat can hold at most 2 people.
Problem Representation
The state can be represented as a tuple:

State: 
(
𝑀
bank1
,
𝐶
bank1
,
𝑀
boat
,
𝐶
boat
,
𝑀
bank2
,
𝐶
bank2
)
State: (M 
bank1
​
 ,C 
bank1
​
 ,M 
boat
​
 ,C 
boat
​
 ,M 
bank2
​
 ,C 
bank2
​
 )
Where:

𝑀
M and 
𝐶
C are the counts of missionaries and cannibals on the respective sides or in the boat.
There is a similar tuple for the second set.
Each action transitions between states by moving people between banks using the boat.

Approach
State Transition Function: The boat can carry:

1 missionary
1 cannibal
2 missionaries
2 cannibals
1 missionary and 1 cannibal
After each boat crossing:

Update the counts on both banks.
Check if the resulting state satisfies the constraints.
Search Algorithm:

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Systematically explores all possible sequences of actions, guaranteeing the shortest solution.
Depth-First Search (DFS): May explore a valid solution faster but is not guaranteed to find the shortest path.
Backtracking: Use DFS with a constraint-satisfaction approach to prune invalid states early.
Doubling Complexity:

For two separate sets, treat them as independent problems and solve them simultaneously, ensuring that their state transitions do not interact.

        for move in possible_boat_moves():
            new_state = apply_move(set_idx, state, move)
            if is_valid_state(new_state):
                valid_states.append((new_state, move))
                
    return valid_states
This framework can be expanded with a solver for each independent set and a plan representation. Let me know if you'd like me to write out the specific state generation or validation logic!
