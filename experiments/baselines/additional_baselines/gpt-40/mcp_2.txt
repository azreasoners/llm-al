There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. Additionally, the missionaries and cannibals all have different hats. These hats can be exchanged among them.

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

The Missionaries and Cannibals problem is a classic example of a constraint-satisfaction problem. To solve it, we need to generate a sequence of valid moves that respect the problem's constraints, ensuring no missionaries are eaten at any stage of the process. Below is a logical sequence that satisfies the problem description:

Representation:
State: Each state is represented as (M1, C1, B, M2, C2), where:

M1 = number of missionaries on bank1.
C1 = number of cannibals on bank1.
B = boat location (1 for bank1, 2 for bank2).
M2 = number of missionaries on bank2.
C2 = number of cannibals on bank2.
Initial State: (3, 3, 1, 0, 0).

Goal State: (0, 0, 2, 3, 3).

Plan:
Moves (described step by step):
(3, 3, 1, 0, 0) → (2, 2, 2, 1, 1)

Two cannibals cross the river to bank2.
(2, 2, 2, 1, 1) → (3, 2, 1, 0, 1)

One cannibal returns to bank1.
(3, 2, 1, 0, 1) → (1, 2, 2, 2, 1)

Two missionaries cross to bank2.
(1, 2, 2, 2, 1) → (2, 2, 1, 1, 1)

One missionary and one cannibal return to bank1.
(2, 2, 1, 1, 1) → (0, 2, 2, 3, 1)

Two missionaries cross to bank2.
(0, 2, 2, 3, 1) → (0, 3, 1, 3, 0)

One cannibal returns to bank1.
(0, 3, 1, 3, 0) → (0, 1, 2, 3, 2)

Two cannibals cross to bank2.
(0, 1, 2, 3, 2) → (0, 2, 1, 3, 1)

One cannibal returns to bank1.
(0, 2, 1, 3, 1) → (0, 0, 2, 3, 3)

Two cannibals cross to bank2.
Explanation:
Each move respects the constraints:

The boat carries at most two people.
The missionaries are never outnumbered by the cannibals on either bank or in the boat.
The sequence achieves the goal state (0, 0, 2, 3, 3) where all missionaries and cannibals are safely at bank2.
