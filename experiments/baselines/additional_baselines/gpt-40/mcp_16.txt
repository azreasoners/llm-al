There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Five missionaries and five cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. At any location, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. Additionally, there is an island also which the boat can go to.

boat is a vessel. bank1, bank2, and island are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Five missionaries and five cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

This is a classical problem in AI and logic-based reasoning, often solved using state-space search. Below is a breakdown of how to approach the problem systematically:

States
A state in the problem can be represented as a tuple:

Number of missionaries at bank1
Number of cannibals at bank1
Location of the boat (bank1, bank2, or island)
For instance:

(5, 5, bank1) represents all missionaries and cannibals are on bank1 with the boat.
(3, 3, island) represents 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals at bank1, and the boat is on the island.
Actions
The actions involve moving the boat with combinations of missionaries and cannibals (0 to 2 people in the boat):

Move 1 missionary
Move 2 missionaries
Move 1 cannibal
Move 2 cannibals
Move 1 missionary and 1 cannibal
Constraints
Cannibals must not outnumber missionaries on any bank, island, or in the boat.
The boat cannot be empty when crossing the river.
The boat's capacity is 2.
Goal State
The goal is:

(0, 0, bank2) (all missionaries and cannibals have crossed to bank2).
Algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
We can use BFS to find the shortest sequence of valid moves from the initial state (5, 5, bank1) to the goal state (0, 0, bank2).

Initialize:

Start with the initial state: (5, 5, bank1).
Use a queue to track states to explore and a set to track visited states.
Expand States:

For each state, generate all possible valid moves (all combinations of missionaries and cannibals).
Check constraints to ensure the state is valid.
Add the new valid states to the queue.
Terminate:

When the goal state (0, 0, bank2) is reached, reconstruct the path of moves to achieve this state.

def valid_state(m, c):
    # Ensure missionaries >= cannibals when > 0
    return (m == 0 or m >= c) and (5 - m == 0 or 5 - m >= 5 - c)

def bfs():
    initial = (5, 5, 'bank1')
    goal = (0, 0, 'bank2')
    queue = deque([(initial, [])])  # Each element: (state, path_to_state)
    visited = set()
    
    while queue:
        current, path = queue.popleft()
        m, c, boat = current
        if current == goal:
            return path  # Solution found
        
        # Skip if already visited
        if current in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(current)
        
        # Generate next states
        if boat == 'bank1':
            directions = [(m - x, c - y, 'island') for x in range(3) for y in range(3) if valid_state(x, y)]
