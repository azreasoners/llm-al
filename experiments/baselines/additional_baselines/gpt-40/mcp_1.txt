There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a rowboat which carries at most two people at once. The rowboat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the rowboat or the missionaries will be eaten. The rowboat's capacity is 2.

rowboat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The rowboat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

This is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and logic programming known as the Missionaries and Cannibals problem. Let's construct a plan that ensures the constraints are respected:

Constraints:

The boat can carry at most two people.
The boat cannot cross the river empty.
On either side of the river or on the boat, the number of cannibals cannot exceed the number of missionaries unless there are no missionaries present.
Initial Setup:

Location bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, and the rowboat.
Location bank2: No missionaries, no cannibals, and no rowboat.
Goal:

Move all missionaries and all cannibals to bank2 while respecting the constraints.
Here is a step-by-step plan:

Step 1: Missionary and Cannibal Cross to bank2
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals, and rowboat.
Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal.
Step 2: Cannibal Returns to bank1
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals, and rowboat.
Bank2: 1 missionary.
Step 3: Two Cannibals Cross to bank2
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal, and rowboat.
Bank2: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals.
Step 4: Cannibal Returns to bank1
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals, and rowboat.
Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal.
Step 5: Two Missionaries Cross to bank2
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals, and rowboat.
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal.
Step 6: One Missionary and One Cannibal Return to bank1
Bank1: 1 missionary, 3 cannibals, and rowboat.
Bank2: 2 missionaries.
Step 7: Two Cannibals Cross to bank2
Bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal, and rowboat.
Bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals.
Step 8: Cannibal Returns to bank1
Bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals, and rowboat.
Bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal.
Step 9: Two Cannibals Cross to bank2
Bank1: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals, and rowboat.
Bank2: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals.
Step 10: Missionary Returns to bank1
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals, and rowboat.
Bank2: 1 missionary, 3 cannibals.
Step 11: Two Missionaries Cross to bank2
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals, and rowboat.
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals.
This plan ensures that:

The boat never crosses empty.
Missionaries are never outnumbered by cannibals on either side or on the boat.
