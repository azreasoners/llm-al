Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. There is one large cannibal and one small missionary, which if left alone the small missionary will be eaten.

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries, cannibals, small missionaries, and big cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

This problem can be modeled as a state-space search problem. We need to define the initial state, goal state, and transitions (or actions) that allow us to move between states while respecting the constraints.

Definitions:
State: Represent the state as a tuple 
(
𝑀
1
,
𝐶
1
,
𝑀
2
,
𝐶
2
,
𝐵
)
(M1,C1,M2,C2,B), where:

𝑀
1
M1: Number of missionaries on bank1.
𝐶
1
C1: Number of cannibals on bank1.
𝑀
2
M2: Number of missionaries on bank2.
𝐶
2
C2: Number of cannibals on bank2.
𝐵
B: Location of the boat (0 for bank1, 1 for bank2).
Initial State: 
(
3
,
3
,
0
,
0
,
0
)
(3,3,0,0,0).

Goal State: 
(
0
,
0
,
3
,
3
,
1
)
(0,0,3,3,1).

Transitions: Moves involving up to two people crossing the river. Possible moves include:

Sending one missionary.
Sending one cannibal.
Sending two missionaries.
Sending two cannibals.
Sending one missionary and one cannibal.
Constraints:

On both banks and in the boat, cannibals can never outnumber missionaries unless there are no missionaries.
The boat cannot cross empty.
The small missionary cannot be left alone with the large cannibal.
Plan:
To solve the problem, a common approach is to use breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible states while avoiding invalid ones. Here's the solution step-by-step:

Move one cannibal from bank1 to bank2: 
(

)
(3,2,0,1,1)

Move one cannibal back to bank1:

Move one cannibal back to bank1:

Move two missionaries from bank1 to bank2:

Move one missionary and one cannibal back to bank1:

Move two missionaries from bank1 to bank2: 
(

(0,3,3,0,1)

Move one cannibal back to bank1: 
(

−

)
(0,4,3,−1,0) (Invalid)

Apologies for the confusion in the last step. Let's correct the solution plan. Here's the complete and valid solution:

(3,2,0,1,1)

Move the cannibal back to bank1:

Move one cannibal back to bank1:

Move one missionary and one cannibal back to bank1:

Move two missionaries from bank1 to bank2:

Move one cannibal back to bank1:

Let's refine the solution logically step by step and ensure we respect all constraints:

(0,2,3,1,0)

Move two cannibals from bank1 to bank2:
(

Final State:

)
(0,0,3,3,1), which satisfies all constraints.
