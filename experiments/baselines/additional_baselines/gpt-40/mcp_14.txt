There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. The river leaks if there are two people inside of it, in which case water needs to be bailed while crossing. A single person cannot row and bail simultaneously.

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

This problem is a classic logic puzzle with additional constraints due to the leaking boat. To solve it, we need to keep track of the following:

The state of the system, defined by:

The number of missionaries and cannibals at each bank.
The location of the boat (bank1 or bank2).
Whether the boat is leaking (requires two passengers).
Actions that transition the state, such as moving 1 or 2 people across the river, with careful adherence to the rules:

Missionaries must never be outnumbered by cannibals at any location.
Two people in the boat trigger the need to bail water, which prevents single passengers from rowing and bailing.
A goal state where all missionaries and cannibals are safely on bank2.

Approach
Define initial state:

bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, and the boat.
bank2: empty.
Define constraints:

Never outnumber missionaries with cannibals.
Two passengers on the boat require cooperation (one to row, one to bail water).
Define valid moves:

1 or 2 missionaries, 1 or 2 cannibals, or 1 missionary and 1 cannibal may cross the river.
Use a search algorithm:

Breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) can explore all possible states while avoiding invalid configurations and revisited states.
