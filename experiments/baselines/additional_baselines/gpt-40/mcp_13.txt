There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Five missionaries and five cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. Additionally, there is a bridge which can be used to cross two people at once. To use the bridge there must at least one person using it.

Instance: 
boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Five missionaries and five cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

This problem can be solved using a state-space search approach, where each state represents the configuration of the missionaries, cannibals, and boat locations, and the goal is to find a sequence of actions (or moves) that transitions from the initial state to the goal state.

Problem Representation
State Representation: A state can be represented as a tuple:

Initial State: 
(
5
,
5
,
0
,
0
,
1
)
(5,5,0,0,1)

Goal State: 
(
0
,
0
,
5
,
5
,
2
)
(0,0,5,5,2)

Constraints:

At any time, missionaries should not be outnumbered by cannibals on either bank or in the boat.
The boat cannot cross the river empty.
The boat has a capacity of 2.
Actions: Each action involves moving 1 or 2 people (missionaries or cannibals) from one bank to the other, depending on the boat's location.

Algorithm
A breadth-first search (BFS) is well-suited for this problem since it ensures the shortest sequence of actions. Here's a high-level algorithm:

Start with the initial state: 
(
5
,
5
,
0
,
0
,
1
)
(5,5,0,0,1).
Use a queue to explore all possible moves from the current state.
For each state, apply valid moves:
Move one missionary.
Move one cannibal.
Move two missionaries.
Move two cannibals.
Move one missionary and one cannibal.
Check the resulting state:
Ensure that missionaries are not outnumbered.
Ensure the boat capacity constraint is met.
Mark visited states to avoid loops.
Stop when the goal state is reached.
Steps to Solve
Transition Rules: For each valid move:

Update the counts of missionaries and cannibals on both banks.
Update the boat's location.
Verification: Ensure constraints are met for each generated state.

Output: Generate a sequence of actions that leads to the goal state.

(5,3,0,2,2)
Move one cannibal back to bank1:

(5,4,0,1,1)
Move two cannibals to bank2:

(5,2,0,3,2)
Move one cannibal back to bank1:

Move two missionaries to bank2: 
(

(4,4,1,1,1)
Continue this pattern until all are at bank2.
