There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Six missionaries and six cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 3. Only one boat can cross at a time.

Instance: 
boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Six missionaries and six cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

The Missionaries and Cannibals problem is a classic example of a constraint satisfaction problem. To solve it, we need to define a sequence of valid moves that transfers all missionaries and cannibals from bank1 to bank2 without violating the constraints:

Constraints:

The boat can carry at most two people.
Cannibals can never outnumber missionaries on either bank or on the boat.
The boat cannot cross the river empty.
Initial State:

bank1: 6 missionaries, 6 cannibals.
bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals.
boat: At bank1.
Goal State:

bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals.
bank2: 6 missionaries, 6 cannibals.
boat: At bank2.
Representation: A state can be represented as a tuple 
(
𝑀
1
,
𝐶
1
,
𝐵
)
(M 
1
​
 ,C 
1
​
 ,B), where:

𝑀
1
M 
1
​
  is the number of missionaries on bank1.
𝐶
1
C 
1
​
  is the number of cannibals on bank1.
𝐵
B indicates the boat's location (bank1 or bank2).
Transitions: Valid moves involve transferring

0≤x+y≤2,x,y≥0) across the river, subject to constraints.

Solution: A solution involves generating a valid sequence of states that transition from the initial state to the goal state. Here's one possible sequence:

At each step, validate the state to ensure no constraints are violated. This plan guarantees all 6 missionaries and 6 cannibals safely cross the river.
