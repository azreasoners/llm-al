There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. Missionaries cannot row.

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

The Missionaries and Cannibals problem is a classic puzzle in artificial intelligence and problem-solving. Here's a solution represented as a sequence of moves, with the state described by the following tuple:

(
M1
,
C1
,
B
,
M2
,
C2
)
(M1,C1,B,M2,C2)
Where:

M1
M1: Number of missionaries on bank1.
C1
C1: Number of cannibals on bank1.
B
B: Location of the boat (1 for bank1, 2 for bank2).
M2
M2: Number of missionaries on bank2.
C2
C2: Number of cannibals on bank2.
