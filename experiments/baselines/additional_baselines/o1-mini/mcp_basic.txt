There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2.

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

Thought for a few seconds
Laying out the options

I'm examining the problem through the lens of the vessel, locations, groups, and integers. The initial setup involves 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals at bank1, with the goal of transferring them to bank2 via the boat.

Outlining the approach

OK, let me see. Iâ€™m starting with a step-by-step plan for transferring 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals to bank2, ensuring cannibals never outnumber missionaries at any bank or on the boat.

Certainly! Below is a step-by-step plan to safely transport all three missionaries and three cannibals from bank1 to bank2 using the boat. The plan ensures that at no point do cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank or on the boat.

Definitions:
Vessel: boat
Locations: bank1 (starting side), bank2 (destination side)
Groups:
missionaries: 3 individuals
cannibals: 3 individuals
Integers: 0 to 10 (used to represent counts)
Constraints:
The boat can carry a maximum of 2 people.
The boat cannot cross the river empty.
On either bank or the boat, cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries to prevent missionaries from being eaten.
Initial State:
bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Boat Location: bank1
Step-by-Step Plan:
First Crossing:

Action: 2 cannibals (2 cannibals) cross from bank1 to bank2.
State:
bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Boat Location: bank2
Return Trip:

Action: 1 cannibal (1 cannibal) returns to bank1.
State:
bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Boat Location: bank1
Second Crossing:

Action: 2 cannibals (2 cannibals) cross from bank1 to bank2.
State:
bank1: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Boat Location: bank2
Return Trip:

Action: 1 cannibal (1 cannibal) returns to bank1.
State:
bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Boat Location: bank1
Third Crossing:

Action: 2 missionaries (2 missionaries) cross from bank1 to bank2.
State:
bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Boat Location: bank2
Return Trip:

Action: 1 missionary and 1 cannibal (1 missionary + 1 cannibal) return to bank1.
State:
bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
Boat Location: bank1
Fourth Crossing:

Action: 2 missionaries (2 missionaries) cross from bank1 to bank2.
State:
bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Boat Location: bank2
Return Trip:

Action: 1 cannibal (1 cannibal) returns to bank1.
State:
bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Boat Location: bank1
Final Crossing:

Action: 2 cannibals (2 cannibals) cross from bank1 to bank2.
Final State:
bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Boat Location: bank2
Final Return Trip:

Action: 1 cannibal (1 cannibal) returns to bank1.
State:
bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Boat Location: bank1
Last Crossing:

Action: 2 cannibals (2 cannibals) cross from bank1 to bank2.
Final State:
bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Boat Location: bank2
Summary:
All three missionaries and three cannibals have successfully crossed from bank1 to bank2 without violating any constraints. At each step, the number of missionaries is never outnumbered by cannibals on either bank or on the boat.

Visual Representation:
Step	Action	bank1 (M,C)	bank2 (M,C)	Boat Location
0	Initial State	(3,3)	(0,0)	bank1
1	2 Cannibals cross to bank2	(3,1)	(0,2)	bank2
2	1 Cannibal returns to bank1	(3,2)	(0,1)	bank1
3	2 Cannibals cross to bank2	(3,0)	(0,3)	bank2
4	1 Cannibal returns to bank1	(3,1)	(0,2)	bank1
5	2 Missionaries cross to bank2	(1,1)	(2,2)	bank2
6	1 Missionary & 1 Cannibal return to bank1	(2,2)	(1,1)	bank1
7	2 Missionaries cross to bank2	(0,2)	(3,1)	bank2
8	1 Cannibal returns to bank1	(0,3)	(3,0)	bank1
9	2 Cannibals cross to bank2	(0,1)	(3,2)	bank2
10	1 Cannibal returns to bank1	(0,2)	(3,1)	bank1
11	2 Cannibals cross to bank2	(0,0)	(3,3)	bank2
Notes:
M represents missionaries.
C represents cannibals.
Each action ensures that at no point do cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank or on the boat.
The boat never crosses the river empty and always carries one or two people.
This plan ensures a safe and efficient transfer of all missionaries and cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
