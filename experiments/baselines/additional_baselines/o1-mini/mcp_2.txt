There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. Additionally, the missionaries and cannibals all have different hats. These hats can be exchanged among them.

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.

Problem dynamics

I’m thinking through the modified missionaries and cannibals problem with four types: vessel, location, group, and integer. The goal is to transport them while keeping missionaries safe from cannibals.

Focusing on the sequence

The hats are decorative and not critical to the problem. Crafting a step-by-step plan for the boat trips, ensuring missionaries' safety from cannibals, aligns with achieving the goal.

Navigating the problem

Taking a closer look at each boat trip, starting with two cannibals crossing to the right bank, then one returns to the left, ensuring missionaries remain safe on each side.

Shifting roles

I’m thinking through the boat trips: two cannibals cross to the right, one returns, two missionaries switch places, and so on, until all missionaries and cannibals are safely on the right bank.

Certainly! Below is a step-by-step plan to safely transport all three missionaries and three cannibals from bank1 to bank2 using the boat, adhering to all the given constraints.

Definitions:
Vessel: Boat
Locations: bank1 (starting point), bank2 (destination)
Groups: Missionaries (M), Cannibals (C)
Integers: Represent the number of individuals (0-3 for this problem)
Initial State:
bank1: 3 Missionaries (M), 3 Cannibals (C)
bank2: 0 M, 0 C
Boat Location: bank1
Plan:
Trip 1:

Boat Move: 2 Cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.
State After Move:
bank1: 3M, 1C
bank2: 0M, 2C
Boat Location: bank2
Trip 2:

Boat Move: 1 Cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1.
State After Move:
bank1: 3M, 2C
bank2: 0M, 1C
Boat Location: bank1
Trip 3:

Boat Move: 2 Cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.
State After Move:
bank1: 3M, 0C
bank2: 0M, 3C
Boat Location: bank2
Trip 4:

Boat Move: 1 Cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1.
State After Move:
bank1: 3M, 1C
bank2: 0M, 2C
Boat Location: bank1
Trip 5:

Boat Move: 2 Missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2.
State After Move:
bank1: 1M, 1C
bank2: 2M, 2C
Boat Location: bank2
Trip 6:

Boat Move: 1 Missionary and 1 Cannibal return from bank2 to bank1.
State After Move:
bank1: 2M, 2C
bank2: 1M, 1C
Boat Location: bank1
Trip 7:

Boat Move: 2 Missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2.
State After Move:
bank1: 0M, 2C
bank2: 3M, 1C
Boat Location: bank2
Trip 8:

Boat Move: 1 Cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1.
State After Move:
bank1: 0M, 3C
bank2: 3M, 0C
Boat Location: bank1
Trip 9:

Boat Move: 2 Cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.
State After Move:
bank1: 0M, 1C
bank2: 3M, 2C
Boat Location: bank2
Trip 10:

Boat Move: 1 Cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1.
State After Move:
bank1: 0M, 2C
bank2: 3M, 1C
Boat Location: bank1
Trip 11:

Boat Move: 2 Cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.
Final State:
bank1: 0M, 0C
bank2: 3M, 3C
Boat Location: bank2
Summary of Moves:
Trip	Action	bank1	bank2	Boat Location
1	2C →	3M, 1C	0M, 2C	bank2
2	1C ←	3M, 2C	0M, 1C	bank1
3	2C →	3M, 0C	0M, 3C	bank2
4	1C ←	3M, 1C	0M, 2C	bank1
5	2M →	1M, 1C	2M, 2C	bank2
6	1M + 1C ←	2M, 2C	1M, 1C	bank1
7	2M →	0M, 2C	3M, 1C	bank2
8	1C ←	0M, 3C	3M, 0C	bank1
9	2C →	0M, 1C	3M, 2C	bank2
10	1C ←	0M, 2C	3M, 1C	bank1
11	2C →	0M, 0C	3M, 3C	bank2
Key Points to Ensure Safety:
No Side Overpower: At no point do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank or on the boat.
Boat Capacity: The boat never carries more than two individuals and is never empty during a crossing.
Boat Movement: The boat alternates between banks, ensuring continuous progress toward the goal.
By following this plan meticulously, all missionaries and cannibals will safely reach bank2 without any harm.
