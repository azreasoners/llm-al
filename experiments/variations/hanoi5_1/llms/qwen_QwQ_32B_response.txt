So I've got this problem with five disks and three pegs. The disks are d1, d2, d3, d4, and d5, and they have different weights, with d1 being the heaviest and d5 the lightest. The setup is that d1 is on peg b, d2 is on d1, d3 is on peg c, d4 is on peg a, and d5 is on d4. I need to find a way to stack all the disks on peg c, following the rules that I can't move a disk if there's another disk on top of it, and I can't place a heavier disk onto a lighter one.

First, I need to understand the current state:

- Peg a: d4, d5 (with d5 on top)

- Peg b: d1, d2 (with d2 on top)

- Peg c: d3

My goal is to have all disks on peg c, stacked in order from heaviest to lightest, with d1 at the bottom and d5 at the top.

This seems similar to the Tower of Hanoi problem, but with more disks and specific initial positions. In the classic Tower of Hanoi, all disks start on one peg, and the goal is to move them to another peg, maintaining the order. Here, disks are scattered across different pegs, which complicates things.

I should probably break this down into smaller steps. Maybe I can move disks around to get them all on peg c, one by one, making sure to follow the rules.

Let me think about the heaviest disk, d1. Since it's the heaviest, it needs to be at the bottom of the stack on peg c. But it's currently on peg b, with d2 on top of it. So, I can't move d1 until d2 is moved elsewhere.

So, first, I need to move d2 somewhere else. D2 is on d1 on peg b. Since d2 is lighter than d3, d4, and d5, I need to find a place to put it where there are no disks lighter than it.

Looking at the pegs:

- Peg a has d4 and d5. D5 is lighter than d2, so I can't place d2 on d5. D4 is heavier than d2, so I could place d2 on d4, but d4 is already having d5 on top. So, I need to move d5 first.

Wait, maybe I should consider moving d5 to peg c, which has d3, since d3 is heavier than d5.

But d3 is heavier than d5, so it's allowed to place d5 on d3.

Wait, no. The rule is that a disk cannot be placed onto another disk that is lighter than it. Since d3 is heavier than d5, it's okay to place d5 on d3.

So, step 1: move d5 from peg a to peg c, on top of d3.

Now, peg a has d4, peg b has d1 and d2, peg c has d3 and d5.

Next, I can move d2 from peg b to peg a, on top of d4. Since d4 is heavier than d2, that's allowed.

So, step 2: move d2 from peg b to peg a, on top of d4.

Now, peg a has d4 and d2, peg b has d1, peg c has d3 and d5.

Next, I need to move d1 to peg c. But peg c has d3 and d5, and d1 is heavier than both, so I can't place d1 directly on either of them.

Wait, maybe I need to move d3 and d5 out of the way first.

Alternatively, perhaps I should move d4 from peg a to peg b, on top of d1.

But d1 is heavier than d4, which is allowed.

So, step 3: move d4 from peg a to peg b, on top of d1.

Now, peg a has d2, peg b has d1 and d4, peg c has d3 and d5.

Next, I can move d2 to peg c, on top of d5, since d5 is lighter than d2.

Wait, no. d5 is lighter than d2, so I cannot place d2 on d5. The rule is that a disk cannot be placed onto another disk that is lighter than it.

So, I can't place d2 on d5.

Alternatively, maybe I can place d2 on d3, since d3 is heavier than d2.

Yes, that's allowed.

So, step 4: move d2 from peg a to peg c, on top of d3.

Now, peg a is empty, peg b has d1 and d4, peg c has d3, d2, and d5.

Next, I need to move d1 to peg c, but d1 is heavier than all other disks, so it should go to the bottom.

But peg c has d3, d2, and d5. I need to move those disks out of the way before placing d1.

Wait, perhaps I need to move d3, d2, and d5 to peg a or b, make space for d1 on peg c.

But peg a has nothing, peg b has d1 and d4.

Hmm.

Maybe I should move d3, d2, and d5 to peg a, since peg b has d1 and d4.

So, first, move d5 from peg c to peg a.

Then, move d2 from peg c to peg a, on top of d5.

Finally, move d3 from peg c to peg a, on top of d2.

But wait, d2 is lighter than d3, so placing d3 on d2 is allowed.

So, step 5: move d5 from peg c to peg a.

Step 6: move d2 from peg c to peg a, on top of d5.

Step 7: move d3 from peg c to peg a, on top of d2.

Now, peg a has d5, d2, and d3, peg b has d1 and d4, peg c is empty.

Next, move d1 from peg b to peg c.

Since peg c is empty, that's allowed.

Step 8: move d1 from peg b to peg c.

Now, peg a has d5, d2, d3, peg b has d4, peg c has d1.

Next, move d4 from peg b to peg c, on top of d1.

Since d1 is heavier than d4, that's allowed.

Step 9: move d4 from peg b to peg c, on top of d1.

Now, peg a has d5, d2, d3, peg b is empty, peg c has d1 and d4.

Next, move d2 from peg a to peg b.

Since peg b is empty, that's allowed.

Step 10: move d2 from peg a to peg b.

Now, peg a has d5 and d3, peg b has d2, peg c has d1 and d4.

Next, move d5 from peg a to peg c, on top of d4.

Since d4 is heavier than d5, that's allowed.

Step 11: move d5 from peg a to peg c, on top of d4.

Now, peg a has d3, peg b has d2, peg c has d1, d4, d5.

Next, move d2 from peg b to peg a, on top of d3.

Since d3 is heavier than d2, that's allowed.

Step 12: move d2 from peg b to peg a, on top of d3.

Now, peg a has d3 and d2, peg b is empty, peg c has d1, d4, d5.

Next, move d3 from peg a to peg b.

Since peg b is empty, that's allowed.

Step 13: move d3 from peg a to peg b.

Now, peg a has d2, peg b has d3, peg c has d1, d4, d5.

Next, move d2 from peg a to peg b, on top of d3.

Since d3 is heavier than d2, that's allowed.

Step 14: move d2 from peg a to peg b, on top of d3.

Now, peg a is empty, peg b has d3 and d2, peg c has d1, d4, d5.

Finally, move d3 from peg b to peg c, on top of d1.

Wait, d1 is heavier than d3, which is allowed.

But d4 is on top of d1, so actually, peg c has d1, d4, d5.

I need to move d4 and d5 out of the way before placing d3 on d1.

Wait, perhaps I need to temporarily move d4 and d5 to peg a.

So, step 15: move d5 from peg c to peg a.

Step 16: move d4 from peg c to peg a, on top of d5.

Now, peg a has d5 and d4, peg b has d3 and d2, peg c has d1.

Next, move d3 from peg b to peg c, on top of d1.

Since d1 is heavier than d3, that's allowed.

Step 17: move d3 from peg b to peg c, on top of d1.

Now, peg a has d5 and d4, peg b has d2, peg c has d1 and d3.

Next, move d2 from peg b to peg a, on top of d4.

Since d4 is heavier than d2, that's allowed.

Step 18: move d2 from peg b to peg a, on top of d4.

Now, peg a has d5, d4, and d2, peg b is empty, peg c has d1 and d3.

Next, move d4 from peg a to peg b.

Since peg b is empty, that's allowed.

Step 19: move d4 from peg a to peg b.

Now, peg a has d5 and d2, peg b has d4, peg c has d1 and d3.

Next, move d2 from peg a to peg c, on top of d3.

Since d3 is heavier than d2, that's allowed.

Step 20: move d2 from peg a to peg c, on top of d3.

Now, peg a has d5, peg b has d4, peg c has d1, d3, d2.

Next, move d5 from peg a to peg b, on top of d4.

Since d4 is heavier than d5, that's allowed.

Step 21: move d5 from peg a to peg b, on top of d4.

Now, peg a is empty, peg b has d4 and d5, peg c has d1, d3, d2.

Next, move d4 from peg b to peg a.

Since peg a is empty, that's allowed.

Step 22: move d4 from peg b to peg a.

Now, peg a has d4, peg b has d5, peg c has d1, d3, d2.

Next, move d5 from peg b to peg c, on top of d2.

Since d2 is lighter than d5, that's not allowed.

Wait, d2 is lighter than d5, so I can't place d5 on d2.

Alternatively, maybe I can move d3 from peg c to peg b, on top of d5.

But d5 is lighter than d3, which is allowed.

So, step 23: move d3 from peg c to peg b, on top of d5.

Now, peg a has d4, peg b has d5 and d3, peg c has d1 and d2.

Next, move d2 from peg c to peg a, on top of d4.

Since d4 is heavier than d2, that's allowed.

Step 24: move d2 from peg c to peg a, on top of d4.

Now, peg a has d4 and d2, peg b has d5 and d3, peg c has d1.

Next, move d5 from peg b to peg c, on top of d1.

Since d1 is heavier than d5, that's allowed.

Step 25: move d5 from peg b to peg c, on top of d1.

Now, peg a has d4 and d2, peg b has d3, peg c has d1 and d5.

Next, move d3 from peg b to peg c, on top of d5.

Since d5 is lighter than d3, that's not allowed.

Wait, d5 is lighter than d3, so I can't place d3 on d5.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move d2 from peg a to peg b, on top of d3.

But d3 is heavier than d2, which is allowed.

So, step 26: move d2 from peg a to peg b, on top of d3.

Now, peg a has d4, peg b has d3 and d2, peg c has d1 and d5.

Next, move d3 from peg b to peg c, on top of d5.

Since d5 is lighter than d3, that's not allowed.

Wait, maybe I need to move d4 from peg a to peg c, on top of d1.

Since d1 is heavier than d4, that's allowed.

Step 27: move d4 from peg a to peg c, on top of d1.

Now, peg a is empty, peg b has d3 and d2, peg c has d1 and d4.

Next, move d2 from peg b to peg a.

Since peg a is empty, that's allowed.

Step 28: move d2 from peg b to peg a.

Now, peg a has d2, peg b has d3, peg c has d1 and d4.

Next, move d3 from peg b to peg c, on top of d4.

Since d4 is heavier than d3, that's allowed.

Step 29: move d3 from peg b to peg c, on top of d4.

Now, peg a has d2, peg b is empty, peg c has d1, d4, d3.

Next, move d2 from peg a to peg b.

Since peg b is empty, that's allowed.

Step 30: move d2 from peg a to peg b.

Now, peg a is empty, peg b has d2, peg c has d1, d4, d3.

Next, move d4 from peg c to peg a.

Since peg a is empty, that's allowed.

Step 31: move d4 from peg c to peg a.

Now, peg a has d4, peg b has d2, peg c has d1 and d3.

Next, move d2 from peg b to peg c, on top of d3.

Since d3 is heavier than d2, that's allowed.

Step 32: move d2 from peg b to peg c, on top of d3.

Now, peg a has d4, peg b is empty, peg c has d1, d3, d2.

Next, move d3 from peg c to peg b.

Since peg b is empty, that's allowed.

Step 33: move d3 from peg c to peg b.

Now, peg a has d4, peg b has d3, peg c has d1 and d2.

Next, move d2 from peg c to peg a, on top of d4.

Since d4 is heavier than d2, that's allowed.

Step 34: move d2 from peg c to peg a, on top of d4.

Now, peg a has d4 and d2, peg b has d3, peg c has d1.

Next, move d3 from peg b to peg c, on top of d1.

Since d1 is heavier than d3, that's allowed.

Step 35: move d3 from peg b to peg c, on top of d1.

Now, peg a has d4 and d2, peg b is empty, peg c has d1 and d3.

Next, move d4 from peg a to peg b.

Since peg b is empty, that's allowed.

Step 36: move d4 from peg a to peg b.

Now, peg a has d2, peg b has d4, peg c has d1 and d3.

Next, move d2 from peg a to peg c, on top of d3.

Since d3 is heavier than d2, that's allowed.

Step 37: move d2 from peg a to peg c, on top of d3.

Now, peg a is empty, peg b has d4, peg c has d1, d3, d2.

Next, move d4 from peg b to peg a.

Since peg a is empty, that's allowed.

Step 38: move d4 from peg b to peg a.

Now, peg a has d4, peg b is empty, peg c has d1, d3, d2.

Next, move d3 from peg c to peg b.

Since peg b is empty, that's allowed.

Step 39: move d3 from peg c to peg b.

Now, peg a has d4, peg b has d3, peg c has d1 and d2.

Next, move d2 from peg c to peg a, on top of d4.

Since d4 is heavier than d2, that's allowed.

Step 40: move d2 from peg c to peg a, on top of d4.

Now, peg a has d4 and d2, peg b has d3, peg c has d1.

Next, move d3 from peg b to peg c, on top of d1.

Since d1 is heavier than d3, that's allowed.

Step 41: move d3 from peg b to peg c, on top of d1.

Now, peg a has d4 and d2, peg b is empty, peg c has d1 and d3.

Wait, this seems like I'm going in circles. There must be a better way.

Maybe I should consider the problem differently. Since the disks are already scattered, perhaps I can treat subsets of disks as separate subproblems.

For example, consider d1 and d2 on peg b, and d4 and d5 on peg a, and d3 on peg c.

Maybe I can move d4 and d5 to peg c, then move d1 and d2 accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the standard Tower of Hanoi algorithm but with adjusted initial positions.

Let me recall that in the standard Tower of Hanoi, to move n disks from source to target, using auxiliary, the steps are:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.

2. Move the nth disk from source to target.

3. Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

But here, disks are not all on one peg, so I need to adapt this.

Maybe I can think of the disks that are already in place and focus on moving the others around them.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a recursive approach, considering the lightest disk and building the tower around it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the lightest disk, d5, and ensure it's at the top of the final stack.

To place d5 on top of the stack on peg c, I need to have d5 on top of a heavier disk, which could be d4, d3, d2, or d1.

But ultimately, d5 should be at the top, so perhaps I should first move d5 to peg c, on top of d3 or d4, whichever is appropriate.

But this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to write down all the possible moves step by step.

Let me try again:

Current state:

- Peg a: d4, d5

- Peg b: d1, d2

- Peg c: d3

Goal: All disks on peg c, ordered with d1 at the bottom to d5 at the top.

Plan:

1. Move d5 from peg a to peg b, on top of d2.

   - Peg a: d4

   - Peg b: d1, d2, d5

   - Peg c: d3

2. Move d2 from peg b to peg c, on top of d3.

   - Peg a: d4

   - Peg b: d1, d5

   - Peg c: d3, d2

3. Move d5 from peg b to peg a, on top of d4.

   - Peg a: d4, d5

   - Peg b: d1

   - Peg c: d3, d2

4. Move d1 from peg b to peg c, on top of d3.

   - Peg a: d4, d5

   - Peg b: empty

   - Peg c: d3, d2, d1

5. Move d4 from peg a to peg b.

   - Peg a: d5

   - Peg b: d4

   - Peg c: d3, d2, d1

6. Move d5 from peg a to peg c, on top of d1.

   - Peg a: empty

   - Peg b: d4

   - Peg c: d3, d2, d1, d5

7. Move d4 from peg b to peg c, on top of d1.

   - Peg a: empty

   - Peg b: empty

   - Peg c: d3, d2, d1, d4, d5

Wait, but d4 is heavier than d5, so placing d4 on top of d5 violates the rule because a heavier disk cannot be placed on a lighter one.

So, step 7 is invalid.

I need to find another way.

Perhaps I should not place d5 on top of d1 directly. Maybe I need to place it on top of d4.

Wait, d4 is heavier than d5, so placing d5 on d4 is allowed.

So, maybe I should have d4 on top of d1, then d5 on top of d4.

Let me try again:

Current state:

- Peg a: d4, d5

- Peg b: d1, d2

- Peg c: d3

Plan:

1. Move d5 from peg a to peg c, on top of d3.

   - Peg a: d4

   - Peg b: d1, d2

   - Peg c: d3, d5

2. Move d2 from peg b to peg a, on top of d4.

   - Peg a: d4, d2

   - Peg b: d1

   - Peg c: d3, d5

3. Move d1 from peg b to peg c, on top of d3.

   - Peg a: d4, d2

   - Peg b: empty

   - Peg c: d3, d5, d1

4. Move d4 from peg a to peg b.

   - Peg a: d2

   - Peg b: d4

   - Peg c: d3, d5, d1

5. Move d2 from peg a to peg c, on top of d1.

   - Peg a: empty

   - Peg b: d4

   - Peg c: d3, d5, d1, d2

6. Move d4 from peg b to peg c, on top of d1.

   - Peg a: empty

   - Peg b: empty

   - Peg c: d3, d5, d1, d2, d4

Wait, but again, d4 is heavier than d2, so placing d4 on top of d2 violates the rule.

This isn't working.

Maybe I need to consider moving d3 to another peg to make space.

Let me try a different approach.

Current state:

- Peg a: d4, d5

- Peg b: d1, d2

- Peg c: d3

Goal: All disks on peg c, ordered d1, d3, d2, d4, d5.

Wait, no. The order should be d1 at the bottom, then d3, then d2, then d4, then d5 on top, since d1 is heaviest and d5 is lightest.

But d3 is heavier than d2 and d5, but lighter than d1 and d4.

Wait, no. The order from heaviest to lightest is d1, d2, d3, d4, d5.

So, on peg c, it should be d1 at the bottom, then d2, then d3, then d4, then d5 on top.

Wait, but in my previous plan, I have d3 already on peg c, and d1 needs to be under it.

So, perhaps I need to move d3 to another peg to make room for d1.

Let me try:

1. Move d3 from peg c to peg a, on top of d5.

   - Peg a: d4, d5, d3

   - Peg b: d1, d2

   - Peg c: empty

2. Move d2 from peg b to peg c.

   - Peg a: d4, d5, d3

   - Peg b: d1

   - Peg c: d2

3. Move d1 from peg b to peg c, on top of d2.

   - Peg a: d4, d5, d3

   - Peg b: empty

   - Peg c: d2, d1

4. Move d3 from peg a to peg b.

   - Peg a: d4, d5

   - Peg b: d3

   - Peg c: d2, d1

5. Move d5 from peg a to peg c, on top of d1.

   - Peg a: d4

   - Peg b: d3

   - Peg c: d2, d1, d5

6. Move d4 from peg a to peg c, on top of d5.

   - Peg a: empty

   - Peg b: d3

   - Peg c: d2, d1, d5, d4

7. Move d3 from peg b to peg c, on top of d4.

   - Peg a: empty

   - Peg b: empty

   - Peg c: d2, d1, d5, d4, d3

Again, this is not the correct order. I need d1, d2, d3, d4, d5 on peg c.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the order of movements.

Let me think differently. Maybe I can treat this as moving d1 to peg c, then building the rest on top of it.

But d1 is on peg b with d2 on top of it. So, I need to move d2 out of the way before moving d1.

Let me try:

1. Move d2 from peg b to peg a, on top of d5.

   - Peg a: d4, d5, d2

   - Peg b: d1

   - Peg c: d3

2. Move d1 from peg b to peg c.

   - Peg a: d4, d5, d2

   - Peg b: empty

   - Peg c: d3, d1

3. Move d2 from peg a to peg b.

   - Peg a: d4, d5

   - Peg b: d2

   - Peg c: d3, d1

4. Move d3 from peg c to peg a, on top of d5.

   - Peg a: d4, d5, d3

   - Peg b: d2

   - Peg c: d1

5. Move d5 from peg a to peg b, on top of d2.

   - Peg a: d4, d3

   - Peg b: d2, d5

   - Peg c: d1

6. Move d3 from peg a to peg c, on top of d1.

   - Peg a: d4

   - Peg b: d2, d5

   - Peg c: d1, d3

7. Move d4 from peg a to peg c, on top of d3.

   - Peg a: empty

   - Peg b: d2, d5

   - Peg c: d1, d3, d4

8. Move d2 from peg b to peg a.

   - Peg a: d2

   - Peg b: d5

   - Peg c: d1, d3, d4

9. Move d5 from peg b to peg c, on top of d4.

   - Peg a: d2

   - Peg b: empty

   - Peg c: d1, d3, d4, d5

10. Move d2 from peg a to peg c, on top of d4.

    - Peg a: empty

    - Peg b: empty

    - Peg c: d1, d3, d4, d2, d5

Again, this is not the correct order. d2 should be between d3 and d4.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to look for a different strategy.

Perhaps using a simulation or a program to find the minimal number of moves would be better, but since this is a manual process, I need to find a way to minimize errors.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the problem as moving subsets of disks independently.

For example, move d4 and d5 to peg c, then move d1 and d2, and place d3 in between.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I want to move d1 to peg c. To do that, I need to have peg c available, which means moving d3 out of the way.

But d3 is on peg c, so I need to move d3 to another peg.

Let's say I move d3 to peg b, on top of d2.

Wait, d2 is on d1 on peg b. So, to move d3 to peg b, I need to have d2 available, which means moving d2 first.

This seems similar to the initial steps I took earlier.

It feels like I'm going in circles.

Maybe I need to accept that solving this manually is too error-prone and look for a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that since d3 is already on peg c, and d1 needs to be under it, I should move d1 to peg c first, then place d3 on top of it, and then build the rest.

But d1 is on peg b with d2 on top, so I need to move d2 out of the way first.

Let me try:

1. Move d2 from peg b to peg a, on top of d5.

   - Peg a: d4, d5, d2

   - Peg b: d1

   - Peg c: d3

2. Move d1 from peg b to peg c.

   - Peg a: d4, d5, d2

   - Peg b: empty

   - Peg c: d3, d1

3. Move d3 from peg c to peg a, on top of d2.

   - Peg a: d4, d5, d2, d3

   - Peg b: empty

   - Peg c: d1

4. Move d5 from peg a to peg b.

   - Peg a: d4, d2, d3

   - Peg b: d5

   - Peg c: d1

5. Move d2 from peg a to peg c, on top of d1.

   - Peg a: d4, d3

   - Peg b: d5

   - Peg c: d1, d2

6. Move d3 from peg a to peg b, on top of d5.

   - Peg a: d4

   - Peg b: d5, d3

   - Peg c: d1, d2

7. Move d5 from peg b to peg c, on top of d2.

   - Peg a: d4

   - Peg b: d3

   - Peg c: d1, d2, d5

8. Move d3 from peg b to peg c, on top of d5.

   - Peg a: d4

   - Peg b: empty

   - Peg c: d1, d2, d5, d3

9. Move d4 from peg a to peg c, on top of d5.

   - Peg a: empty

   - Peg b: empty

   - Peg c: d1, d2, d5, d3, d4

Again, this is not the correct order.

I'm clearly missing something here. Maybe I need to consider that d3 should be between d2 and d4 in the final stack.

Wait, according to the weight order, d1 is heaviest, then d2, then d3, then d4, then d5.

So, on peg c, it should be d1 at the bottom, then d2, then d3, then d4, then d5 on top.

So, in the final stack on peg c: d1, d2, d3, d4, d5.

Let me try to think about moving d1 to peg c, then d2 on top of d1, then d3 on top of d2, and so on.

But d1 is on peg b with d2 on top of it. So, to move d1, I need to move d2 out of the way first.

Similarly, d3 is already on peg c, which is where I want all disks to be, but it's not in the correct position yet.

This is really tricky.

Maybe I should look for a general algorithm for the Tower of Hanoi with multiple pegs, as this seems like a variant of that problem.

In the Tower of Hanoi with multiple pegs, there are more efficient ways to move the disks, but it's also more complex to keep track of the moves.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the problem as a series of steps where I move the smallest disks to create space for the larger ones.

Given the time constraints, I think I'll stop here and conclude that solving this problem manually requires a lot of careful planning and is prone to errors without a systematic approach or a program to find the optimal sequence of moves.
