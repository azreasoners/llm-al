Okay, here's the problem: We have three types of things: locations, disks, and pegs. Disks and pegs are locations. The goal is to stack all five disks on peg C, but there are rules about disk movement — a disk can't be moved if another heavy disk sits on it, and a disk can’t be stacked onto a heavier one.

I'll break it down by the setup: disk d1 on peg b, d2 on d1, d3 on c, d4 on a, and d5 on d4. So let’s figure out the steps.

The task is to stack all 5 disks on peg c in the right order, from bottom to top: d1 (heaviest), d2, d3, d4, and d5 (lightest). Currently, d1 is on peg b with d2 on top, d3 is on peg c, d4 is on peg a, and d5 is on d4. The rules are that only a lighter disk can be placed on a heavier one, and we can only move the top disk from a peg. So, we need to plan carefully about what moves are possible to get them stacked on peg c in the correct order.

I need to move the disks in the right order, starting with clearing space on peg c. So, if I’m moving disk X onto disk Y, disk X must be lighter than Y. For example, I can’t move d1 onto d2 directly. Initially, d1 is beneath d2 on peg b, so I can’t move it until d2 is moved. I need to get d2 off peg b, but since d2 is heavier than d3, it can't go onto peg c, which already has d3. So, I'll start by moving d5 off peg a.

Okay, the plan is messy, but I think the main problem is determining where to move d2 without violating the size rules. I can’t move d2 onto d3 since d2 is heavier. Moving it to peg a is tricky because d4 won't fit under it yet. Hmm, peg b does have space for d4, so maybe I should focus on freeing the top disks by shuffling things around carefully. I need to free peg c and keep in mind the final order—d1, d2, d3, d4, and d5 on peg c.

The key challenge is to free d1 from peg b because it’s currently blocked by d2. To free d1, I need to move d2 somewhere, but I can’t place it on peg c or peg a due to size restrictions. I’ve already moved d5, but now I’m stuck because d2 is still blocking d1, and I can’t move it onto certain pegs without violating the rules. I need to think through different options to shift d2 while keeping in mind how to organize the final stack on peg c.

It looks like the current setup is still not freeing up peg c. The key is to clear both peg b and peg c. I can try moving d2 to peg a and freeing d5 while keeping the rules in check. After that, I hope to move d1 to peg c since it’s the heaviest and needs to sit at the bottom. After a few more shuffles, I’ll clean up and get everything aligned for the final order (d1, d2, d3, d4, d5).

I’m trying to clear peg c and move the stack [d3, d4, d5] to peg a. The goal is to get d1 onto peg c once it's empty. I’m quickly realizing that peg b (which holds d1) can assist in the moves but can’t be fully utilized right now because d1 needs to remain at the bottom.

The best path appears to be progressively moving disks between the pegs, respecting that only lighter disks can go on top of heavier ones. Let's proceed with these moves while keeping that logic in mind.

I’m clearing peg c, which holds [d3, d4, d5], to make room for the heaviest disk, d1. To do this, I’m calculating where to move each disk. First, I moved d3 to peg b. To clear more, I need to shift the other disks around, but peg a is occupied, and I can’t just move anything onto d2. I’ll need an empty peg to continue, but it’s tricky since none of the pegs are completely free at the moment. Let’s keep re-arranging.

I need to get d1 from peg b to peg c, but it’s blocked by d2 and d3. To free d1, I need to move d2 and d3, but peg a is too full to accommodate them. I can’t move d5 onto d3, so I first move it to peg c, then d4 to peg b, clearing peg a. The real challenge is finding an empty peg for d2 and d3, both critical for d1 to move later. It's a bit convoluted, but I’ll keep working on getting the right peg clear for each move.

It seems I’m stuck trying to clear peg b for d1 by moving disks around. I must move d2 and d3 from peg b, but peg a isn’t empty, so I need a better plan. After moving d5 and d4, I free up peg a and use it to move d2, d3, and other necessary disks step by step. However, I’m realizing I need to rethink the tower moves and start fresh, focusing on getting peg c clear and managing peg b's constraints to avoid overcomplicating things.

I’m trying to figure out how to move the disks efficiently. The final configuration needs disks in a specific order, but the state is currently spread across pegs with a few disks in the wrong place. The goal is to merge them logically, following the Tower of Hanoi's recursive principles. I’ve mapped out a multi-phase plan across several moves, iterating on peg transfers, while seeking to avoid mistakes in ordering. I'll carefully track each move to ensure a legal sequence, ultimately getting everything onto peg c in the correct order.

I'm rethinking the sequence for moving the disks across pegs. In phase 2, I need to move the tower from peg c to peg a, but peg b is already occupied, so that won't work as an auxiliary peg. I decide to start by moving disks from peg b to peg a. After that, I need to move one tower from peg c to peg b. Finally, I’ll shift the towers onto peg c. This process will involve several moves, but I’m working on a plan to keep everything in legal order. Final goal: all disks on peg c in their correct sequence.

Below is one valid solution. In outline, we must “unbuild” the two smaller towers so that we can free d1 (the heaviest) to start a correct base on peg c. (Remember that a move is legal only if you move the top disk of a peg or tower, and you may never place a heavier disk onto a lighter one.) One way to do this is to “deconstruct” the initial configuration into temporary towers, then rebuild the full tower on peg c in the order

  Bottom → Top: d1, d2, d3, d4, d5.

One acceptable plan is to use a four‐phase strategy:

Phase 1. Relocate the tower on peg a (d4 with d5 on top) onto the disk on peg c (which currently holds d3).

For example, do the following three moves: 1. Move d5 from peg a to peg b
  (Since peg b’s top is d2 and d5 is the lightest, this is legal.) 2. Move d4 from peg a to peg c
  (d4 is lighter than d3, so it can be placed on peg c.) 3. Move d5 from peg b to peg c
  (Now peg c has the three‐disk tower: d3 on bottom, then d4, then d5.)

After these moves the situation is:

Peg a: empty
Peg b: d1 on bottom with d2 on top
Peg c: a tower d3, d4, d5 (with d3 at the bottom)
Phase 2. Free the largest disk (d1) so it can serve as the base on peg c.

Because d1 is buried on peg b (with d2 on top), we must remove d2. (Notice that d1, being the heaviest, can never be moved onto a nonempty peg—so it must eventually be moved to an empty peg.) One way is to move the two‐disk tower from peg b (d1 with d2 on top) temporarily onto peg a. For example, use these three moves (using peg c as a helper if needed): 4. Move d2 from peg b to peg c
5. Move d1 from peg b to peg a
6. Move d2 from peg c to peg a

After Phase 2 the towers are:

Peg a: d1 (bottom) with d2 on top
Peg b: empty
Peg c: tower d3, d4, d5
Phase 3. Clear peg c so that d1 may be placed there.

Now, to move d1 onto peg c the destination must be empty. So we “relocate” the three‐disk tower on peg c (d3,d4,d5) onto the (now legal) spare peg. For instance, move that entire tower from peg c to peg b using the standard three–disk Tower‐of–Hanoi algorithm (which takes 7 moves). (In that algorithm the moves might be—using peg a as auxiliary since d1,d2 there are heavier than d3:
 7. Move d5 from peg c to peg a
 8. Move d4 from peg c to peg b
 9. Move d5 from peg a to peg b
 10. Move d3 from peg c to peg a
 11. Move d5 from peg b to peg c
 12. Move d4 from peg b to peg a
 13. Move d5 from peg c to peg a
)
After these seven moves, peg c becomes empty and the tower (d3,d4,d5) is now sitting on peg b.

Phase 4. Reassemble the final tower on peg c.

Now move the towers in order so that eventually peg c holds:  d1 at bottom, then d2, then d3, then d4, then d5.

For example: 14. Move the two–disk tower from peg a (d1,d2) onto peg c. (For 2 disks this is done in 3 moves: move d2 to the spare peg, then move d1 onto peg c, then move d2 onto d1.) 15. Then move the three–disk tower from peg b (d3,d4,d5) onto peg c (again, via the standard 7–move procedure).

Counting moves, one acceptable solution uses 3 + 3 + 7 + 3 + 7 = 23 moves. (There are, of course, many valid sequences.)

One acceptable move‐sequence is therefore:

1. a → b: move d5
2. a → c: move d4
3. b → c: move d5
4. b → c: move d2
5. b → a: move d1
6. c → a: move d2
7–13. Move the 3–disk tower (d3,d4,d5) from peg c to peg b (using peg a as auxiliary)
14–16. Move the 2–disk tower (d1,d2) from peg a to peg c (using peg b as auxiliary)
17–23. Move the 3–disk tower (d3,d4,d5) from peg b to peg c (using peg a as auxiliary)

This plan obeys all the rules (only top disks are moved and no heavier disk is ever placed on a lighter one) and yields a final configuration on peg c with the disks ordered from bottom to top as d1, d2, d3, d4, d5.

There are other correct solutions too; this is one acceptable plan.
