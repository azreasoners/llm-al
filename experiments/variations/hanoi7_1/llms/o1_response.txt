Thought about disk stacking problem for 1m 30s
Laying out the options

Let's map out the initial setup: the heaviest disk is on peg A, and the lightest is on peg B. The goal is to move all disks to peg C, respecting the disk order and peg capacity.

Crafting the strategy

I'm piecing together a plan to assemble all disks on peg C. The aim is to stack d7 on top, ensuring disks are arranged by size from heaviest to lightest.

Revisiting the constraints

I‚Äôm re-evaluating the rule against placing a heavier disk on a lighter one, ensuring d4 can go on top of d3 since d3 is heavier than d4.

Crafting the pathway

I‚Äôm piecing together the final peg arrangement, ensuring each disk is light enough to move top of another and checking for obstructions. Progress feels methodical and logical.

Relocating disks

OK, let me see. Moving d6 seems tricky as it‚Äôs under heavier disks like d4 and d5. However, it can go on top of d7, ensuring progress in the rearrangement.

Assessing disk dynamics

Hmm, I‚Äôm thinking about the placement of d6. It‚Äôs too light for d7, and all pegs are occupied. This really complicates the rearrangement.

Strategizing the arrangement

I'm mapping out the placements and realized d6 on d3 would hinder final alignment. Noticing the need to adjust before settling on the final structure.

Repositioning d6

Of course, it‚Äôs important to move d6 off d4 so d4 can be set in its correct spot. Since d3 is heavier, moving d6 to peg c works here.

Reassessing placements

I've figured out that moving d6 to d3 blocks placing d4 on top. To solve this, I plan to relocate d6 to peg b or c, ensuring smooth progression.

Navigating placement hurdles

Hm, I‚Äôm thinking about where to place d6. It‚Äôs tricky to avoid it blocking d4. Considering moving d7 off peg b to put d6 on d5 makes sense.

Aligning movements

OK, let me see. I‚Äôm figuring out the moves to make room for d4 on peg c, ensuring each disk is lighter than the one it‚Äôs placed on top of.

Evaluating options

Hmm, I‚Äôm thinking about moving d7 to peg a. Since d4 is lighter, it fits, and this clears peg c for placing d4. It seems like a solid plan.

Evaluating peg dynamics

I‚Äôm noting that moving d7 to peg a seems doable since d4 is heavier. This clears peg c, but the aim is to achieve the final arrangement with available pegs.

Aligning disks

I‚Äôm working through aligning d4, d5, d6, and d7 on peg c. By clearing pegs and shifting disks accordingly, this final arrangement starts to take shape.

Mapping the path

I‚Äôm laying out the method to stack d4, d5, d6, and d7 in sequence on peg c. Freed pegs and careful disk placement will ensure a well-organized stack.

Navigating disk choices

I‚Äôm thinking through where to place d6 on peg c. Since d6 is lighter than d3, I‚Äôll move d6 to d3, then figure out where to position d4 next.

Taking another look

I'm rethinking d6's placement on peg a or c to clear d6 from peg c. Continuously shifting disks until the optimal arrangement is achieved.

Revisiting the layout

I‚Äôm gathering updated info on disk placements. Moving d6 to d3 leaves d4 on peg a. Clearing peg c allows d4 to be placed on top of d3.

Reassessing steps

I'm realizing that moving d6 to d4 just resets everything. I need to refocus and come up with a different plan to untangle the arrangement.

Clearing the way

I‚Äôm clearing peg b by moving d7 to a heavier spot. This frees up d5 for proper placement, progressing the arrangement towards the final goal.

Piecing together placements

OK, I‚Äôm thinking through how to arrange the stacks. Moving the smallest disk to the top and placing heavier ones on lighter ones seems like a safe bet.

Setting up the stack

I‚Äôm working on positioning d7 on top of d6 and moving d6 to b. This clears up peg a, making it easier to place other disks effectively.

Reshaping the puzzle

OK, I moved d7 to d3 to free up d6. Now I can move d6 to b, onto d5, and clear peg a for placing more disks.

Making space

I‚Äôm ensuring peg a is clear. I moved d7 to d6 and plan to place d4 on top of d3. This tricky arrangement clears the way for the final steps.

Shuffling the setup

I‚Äôm thinking through moving d7 to peg a to clear space for d5 on peg b. This ensures d6 is light enough to be on top of d5.

Rearranging the structure

I‚Äôve decided to place d6 on top of d4 to free up d5 for peg c. Progressing through the arrangement, this reshuffling ensures each peg is utilized effectively.

Making strategic choices

I‚Äôm reconsidering the best spots to move d6 and d7, ensuring no heavier disk ends up on a lighter one. This careful organization is clearly progressing towards the final solution.

Strategizing disk movements

I‚Äôm moving d7 onto d5 to clear space for d6 on peg a. This frees up peg c for final placements, ensuring a neat, organized stack.

Reassessing disk constraints

OK, let's think it through again: lighter disks can go on top of heavier ones. This confirms we can successfully stack d7 on top of d6.

Adjusting my approach

I'm considering the order of d4 and d5. Since d4 is heavier, it should stay below d5. This rearrangement helps in aligning the disks properly.

Ensuring precision

I‚Äôm verifying that d5 can go on top of d4, as the rule allows a lighter disk on a heavier one. This progression is key to staying organized.

Verifying disk order

Checking the order of disks to confirm if d6 can go on top of d5. The rule about lighter disks on heavier ones seems applicable here.

Pulling together the pieces

I‚Äôm piecing together the puzzle by moving d7 to peg b, making space for d6 on peg c, which clears the way for the final disk placements.

Piecing together the solution

I‚Äôve reconciled the final peg arrangement, ensuring each disk fits gracefully. The instructions will be clearly detailed, guiding the optimal strategy for this setup.

Revisiting the strategy

I‚Äôm thinking through the step-by-step moves to align the disks correctly on peg c, ensuring each disk is ordered from heaviest to lightest, and checking the constraints throughout.

Finalizing the sequence

I‚Äôm organizing the final moves. Each step takes into account the pegs and disk constraints, ensuring firmset placement aligns with the rules and guidelines.

Figuring out the arrangement

I‚Äôm piecing together the steps to align the disks, taking care to respect the rules and constraints. Each move is strategic to ensure everything neatly fits together.

Below is one systematic solution (step-by-step ‚Äúplan‚Äù) that obeys the constraints

You cannot move a disk if there is another disk on top of it.
You cannot place a heavier disk on top of a lighter disk.
Starting Configuration
Peg a: d4 (bottom), d6 (on top of d4)
Peg b: d5 (bottom), d7 (on top of d5)
Peg c: d1 (bottom), d2 (on top of d1), d3 (on top of d2)
Recall the weight order (heaviest to lightest):
d1 > d2 > d3 > d4 > d5 > d6 > d7

Our goal is to end with all disks on peg c in order
d1 (bottom) ‚Äì d2 ‚Äì d3 ‚Äì d4 ‚Äì d5 ‚Äì d6 ‚Äì d7 (top).

Notation
‚ÄúMove dX from dY to dZ‚Äù means:

dX was on top of dY (or on top of peg Y if Y is a peg).
We move dX so that it is on top of dZ (or on top of peg Z if Z is a peg).
If we say ‚ÄúMove dX from peg a to peg b,‚Äù it means dX was topmost on peg a, and peg b‚Äôs top is either empty or a strictly heavier disk.
