Here is a plan to stack all the disks on peg c, moving from the initial state to the goal state:

Initial state:

Peg a: d4, d6
Peg b: d5, d7
Peg c: d1, d2, d3
Steps:

Move d7 from peg b to peg a
Move d5 from peg b to peg c
Move d7 from peg a to peg c
Move d6 from peg a to peg b
Move d4 from peg a to peg c
Move d6 from peg b to peg c
Move d3 from peg c to peg a
Move d2 from peg c to peg b
Move d3 from peg a to peg b
Move d1 from peg c to peg a
Move d3 from peg b to peg c
Move d2 from peg b to peg a
Move d3 from peg c to peg a
Move d5 from peg c to peg b
Move d3 from peg a to peg b
Move d2 from peg a to peg c
Move d3 from peg b to peg c
Move d1 from peg a to peg c
Final state:

Peg a: empty
Peg b: empty
Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7
This plan ensures that no disk is ever placed on top of a lighter disk. By systematically moving the disks according to their weights, all disks can be successfully stacked on peg c.
