Here's how you can approach solving this variation of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem.

Understanding the Problem:

Goal: Move all seven disks to peg 'c' in order, with the largest (d1) at the bottom and the smallest (d7) at the top.
Rules:
Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
Disks must be on a peg or another disk (we cannot temporarily hold them elsewhere).
Strategy:

Since this problem has more disks and a slightly different initial configuration, we'll use a combination of the classic Tower of Hanoi strategy and some adjustments.

Divide and Conquer: Think of the problem in terms of moving smaller towers, then combining them.

Intermediate Goals: Set the following as our goals throughout the process:

Goal 1: Get disks d1, d2, and d3 onto peg 'b' in order of size.
Goal 2: Move disks d4, d5, d6, and d7 onto peg 'c' in order of size.
Goal 3: Move the smaller tower of d1, d2, d3 from peg 'b' to peg 'c' on top of the larger disks.
Steps Breakdown:

Goal 1: Getting d1, d2, d3 to peg 'b'

Move d5 and d7 to peg 'a':

Move d7 from d5 to peg 'c'
Move d5 from peg 'b' to peg 'a'
Now we can reach d3. Move the tower of d1, d2, and d3 to peg 'b':

Move d3 from peg 'c' to peg 'a'
Move d2 from d1 to peg 'b'
Move d3 from peg 'a' to peg 'b'
Move d1 from peg 'c' to peg 'b'
Goal 2: Getting d4, d5, d6, d7 to peg 'c'

Move the tower of d5 and d7 back to peg 'b':

Move d7 from peg 'c' to peg 'a'
Move d5 from peg 'a' to peg 'b'
Move d7 from peg 'a' to peg 'b'
Move the d4, d6 tower to peg 'c':

Move d6 from d4 to peg 'b'
Move d4 from peg 'a' to peg 'c'
Move d6 from peg 'b' to peg 'c'
Goal 3: Moving d1, d2, d3 to peg 'c'

Now, this part follows the classic Tower of Hanoi strategy with d1, d2, and d3 as your tower, peg 'b' as the source, peg 'c' as the destination and peg 'a' as the temporary peg.

Move d3 to peg 'c':

Move d2 from peg 'b' to peg 'a'
Move d3 from peg 'b' to peg 'c'
Move d2 from peg 'a' to peg 'c'
Move d1 to peg 'c':

Move d2 from peg 'c' to peg 'b'
Move d1 from peg 'b' to peg 'c'
Move d2 from peg 'b' to peg 'c'
Congratulations! You've successfully stacked all seven disks on peg 'c'.

Important Notes:

This is just one possible solutionâ€”there might be other valid sequences.
The Tower of Hanoi has a recursive solution. If you're interested in a programming solution, the recursive nature of the solution makes it a good algorithm to practice with.
