Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to stack all seven disks onto peg c, right? The disks are ordered from heaviest (d1) to lightest (d7). The initial setup is a bit specific: on peg c, there's d1 with d2 on top, and d3 on top of d2. Then peg a has d4 with d6 on it, and peg b has d5 with d7 on top. Our goal is to get all of them onto peg c in the correct order, with the heaviest at the bottom and the lightest on top.

First, I remember the classic Tower of Hanoi problem. But this seems more complex because there are seven disks and the initial configuration isn't all on one peg. So, the usual recursive approach might not apply directly. Let me list out the initial state to visualize better.

Starting positions:

- Peg c: d1 (bottom), d2, d3 (top)

- Peg a: d4 (bottom), d6 (top)

- Peg b: d5 (bottom), d7 (top)

Order of weight: d1 > d2 > d3 > d4 > d5 > d6 > d7.

Constraints: A disk can't be placed on a lighter one. So, only lighter disks can go on top of heavier ones. Also, you can only move a disk if it's the top one on its current stack.

Our goal is to have all disks on peg c in the order d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7 from bottom to top. Wait, but the heaviest is d1, so the final tower should have d1 at the bottom, then d2, up to d7 on top. But currently, on peg c, we have d1, d2, d3 already. So those three are already in the correct order on the target peg. That's a good start. The problem is moving the other disks (d4, d5, d6, d7) to peg c on top of d3, but following the weight rules.

Wait, but d4 is heavier than d5, which is heavier than d6, which is heavier than d7. So, the order on peg c should be d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7. So, we need to get d4, d5, d6, d7 onto peg c in that order. But d4 is on peg a with d6 on top. So first, we need to move d6 off d4 to place d4 somewhere else. Similarly, peg b has d5 with d7 on top. So d7 needs to be moved first to get to d5.

Let me outline the steps needed:

1. Move d6 from peg a to some peg so that d4 can be moved.

2. Move d4 to peg c, but peg c currently has d3 on top. Wait, d4 is heavier than d3 (since d3 is lighter than d4?), no, wait the order is d1 > d2 > d3 > d4 > d5 > d6 > d7. Wait, no, the order given is "From heaviest to lightest, the disks are d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, and d7." Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the user wrote: "From heaviest to lightest, the disks are d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, and d7." So d1 is heaviest, then d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7 lightest. Wait, that's unusual because in the standard problem, the disks are ordered by size, but here the order is given as heaviest to lightest. So, each next disk is lighter than the previous. So, d1 is the heaviest, d2 is next, etc. So, d3 is heavier than d4. So, in the initial setup on peg c, we have d1, d2, d3. So, those are three heaviest disks already on peg c. Then, d4 is on peg a, d5 on peg b. Then d6 is on d4, and d7 on d5.

So the goal is to get all disks onto peg c in the order from heaviest (d1) at the bottom to lightest (d7) on top. So the final stack should be d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7. But right now, peg c has d1, d2, d3. Peg a has d4 with d6 on top. Peg b has d5 with d7 on top.

So the problem is to move d4, d5, d6, d7 to peg c in the correct order. However, the existing stack on c is d1, d2, d3. So, since d4 is lighter than d3, we can't place d4 directly on d3. Wait, no: the rule is that a disk can't be placed on a lighter disk. Since d3 is heavier than d4, we can place d4 on top of d3. Because d4 is lighter than d3. So that's allowed. Similarly, d5 is lighter than d4, so can be placed on d4. Then d6 on d5, d7 on d6.

Wait, the weight order is d1 > d2 > d3 > d4 > d5 > d6 > d7. So each subsequent disk is lighter. So, in the final stack, each disk above is lighter than the one below. So, for example, d3 can have d4 on top (since d4 is lighter), but that would not be the correct order. Wait no, the final stack must be ordered from heaviest to lightest as d1 (bottom), d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7 (top). So each subsequent disk on top must be lighter. Therefore, after d3 comes d4 (lighter than d3), then d5 (lighter than d4), etc. So the order is correct.

But initially, peg c has d1, d2, d3. So to add d4 on top of d3, that's allowed. Then d5 on d4, etc. So the main issue is moving d4, d5, d6, d7 to peg c in the correct order, considering their current positions.

Let's break down each disk's current location and dependencies:

- d4 is on peg a with d6 on top. So to move d4, we need to first move d6 somewhere else.

- d6 is on d4. So to move d6, since it's the top of peg a, we can move it, but we have to place it on a peg or disk that is heavier than d6. The available heavier disks are d1, d2, d3, d4, d5. But d4 is under d6, so we can't put d6 back there. So possible targets: peg b (but peg b has d5 and d7), peg c (has d3 on top). So d6 can be placed on d3 (since d3 is heavier than d6). Because d3 is heavier than d6 (d3 is heavier than d4, which is heavier than d5, which is heavier than d6). So yes, d3 is heavier than d6. So moving d6 to peg c (on top of d3) would be allowed. Then we can move d4 to peg c on top of d6? Wait no, because d4 is heavier than d6. Wait, d4 is heavier than d6, so we can't place d4 on top of d6. Wait, no, the rule is you can't place a heavier disk on a lighter one. So, if you have a lighter disk on top, that's okay. So d6 can be placed on d3 (heavier), then d4 can be placed on peg c (on top of d3 or on top of d6? Wait, if d6 is on d3, then the top of peg c is d6. But d4 is heavier than d6, so you can't place d4 on d6. Therefore, moving d6 to peg c would block us from placing d4 there. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to move d6 to another peg. Let's see. The other pegs are a, b, c. Peg a currently has d4 and d6. Peg b has d5 and d7. Peg c has d1, d2, d3. So, if we move d6 from peg a to peg b, but peg b has d5 and d7. Since d6 is lighter than d5, we can place d6 on top of d7 (since d7 is lighter than d6? Wait, no, d6 is heavier than d7. Wait, d6 is heavier than d7. So if we try to put d6 on peg b, which has d5 (heavier than d6) with d7 on top (lighter than d6), then we can't put d6 on top of d7 because d6 is heavier than d7. So we can't do that. Alternatively, can we move d7 first?

Wait, peg b has d5 (bottom) and d7 (top). So to move d5, we need to first move d7. So maybe we can move d7 from peg b to another peg. Let's see. If we move d7 to peg c, which has d3 on top. d3 is heavier than d7, so we can place d7 on peg c (on top of d3). Then, after moving d7, we can move d5.

But let's think step by step. The main problem is moving d4 and d5 to peg c. But they are under other disks. Let's outline possible steps:

1. Move d6 from peg a (on d4) to another peg. But where? If we move it to peg c, it can go on top of d3 (since d3 is heavier). But then d6 is on peg c. Then we can move d4 from peg a to peg c, but d4 is heavier than d6, so we can't place d4 on d6. So that's a problem. Alternatively, move d6 to peg b. But peg b has d5 and d7. Since d6 is heavier than d7, we can't place d6 on d7. So the only option is to place d6 on an empty peg. But all pegs are occupied. Wait, the pegs are a, b, c. Peg a has d4 and d6 (but we're moving d6 away). Peg b has d5 and d7. Peg c has d1, d2, d3. So, if we move d6 to peg b, but since d5 is there, we can place d6 on top of d5? Wait, d5 is heavier than d6 (since d5 is heavier than d6), so yes, placing d6 on d5 is allowed. Because d5 is heavier, so placing a lighter disk (d6) on top is okay. Wait, but peg b currently has d5 with d7 on top. So the top disk is d7. So to move d6 to peg b, we need to place it on top of d7. But d6 is heavier than d7, so that's not allowed. So we can't place d6 on d7. Therefore, the only way to place d6 on peg b is to first move d7 from peg b to another peg, then place d6 on d5.

So possible steps:

1. Move d7 from peg b to another peg (maybe peg c, on top of d3).

2. Then move d6 from peg a to peg b (on top of d5).

3. Then move d4 from peg a to peg c (on top of d3).

4. Then move d5 from peg b to peg c (on top of d4).

5. Then move d6 from peg b to peg c (on top of d5).

6. Then move d7 from wherever it was (peg c) to peg c on top of d6.

But let's check if these steps are possible.

Step 1: Move d7 (lightest) from peg b to peg c (on top of d3). That's allowed because d3 is heavier. So peg c becomes d1, d2, d3, d7. But then we need to move d6 from peg a to peg b. But peg b now has d5 (since we moved d7 away). So moving d6 to peg b would place it on d5. Since d5 is heavier than d6, that's allowed. So step 2: move d6 to peg b (on d5). Then peg a now has only d4. Step 3: move d4 from peg a to peg c. But peg c has d3 and d7 on top. Wait, after step 1, peg c has d3 and then d7. So the top disk is d7. To place d4 on peg c, we need to put it on top of d7. But d4 is heavier than d7, so that's not allowed. So this approach won't work. Hmm.

Alternative approach: Maybe after moving d7 to peg c, we can't place d4 on peg c because the top is d7 (lighter). So perhaps we need to move d7 to another peg first. Let's think again.

Alternative idea: Move d7 from peg b to peg a. But peg a has d4 and d6. The top is d6. d7 is lighter than d6, so we can place d7 on d6. Wait, no: d6 is heavier than d7, so placing d7 on d6 is allowed. So step 1: move d7 from peg b to peg a (on top of d6). Then peg b has d5, and peg a has d4, d6, d7.

Then step 2: move d6 from peg a to peg b (on d5). Because now peg a's top is d7. Wait, after moving d7 to peg a on top of d6, the order on peg a is d4, d6, d7. So to move d6, we need to first move d7. So this complicates things. Maybe that's not the best approach.

Alternative plan: Use peg c as the target, but we need to move the smaller disks (d6 and d7) to temporary pegs to allow moving the larger ones (d4 and d5). Since the existing stack on c is d1, d2, d3, which are the three heaviest, we can use pegs a and b as temporary storage for the lighter disks.

Let's consider the problem as moving the disks d4, d5, d6, d7 to peg c on top of d3. Since each of these is lighter than the previous, we can stack them in order d4, d5, d6, d7. But they are currently arranged with d4 under d6 (on peg a) and d5 under d7 (on peg b). So we need to free up d4 and d5 by moving d6 and d7 to temporary locations.

Let's start by moving the smallest disks first. Since d7 is the lightest, we can move it to peg c. But peg c has d3 on top. So moving d7 to peg c is allowed (d3 is heavier). So step 1: move d7 from peg b to peg c. Now peg c has d1, d2, d3, d7. Then, we can move d6 from peg a to peg b (since peg b now has only d5). But peg a has d4 and d6. To move d6, we need to have nothing on top of it. Currently, d6 is under nothing, so we can move it. Wait, no: peg a has d4 as the bottom disk, then d6 on top. So d6 is the top disk. So yes, we can move d6. So step 2: move d6 from peg a to peg b (on top of d5). But d5 is heavier than d6, so that's allowed. Now peg b has d5, d6. Then step 3: move d4 from peg a to peg c. But peg c has d7 on top. d4 is heavier than d7, so we can't place d4 on d7. So this is a problem. Hmm.

Alternative idea: After moving d7 to peg c, we need to move it again to allow placing d4. Maybe move d7 to another peg. Let's try:

Step 1: Move d7 from peg b to peg a (on top of d6). Since d6 is heavier than d7, that's allowed. Now peg a has d4, d6, d7. Peg b has d5. Peg c has d1, d2, d3.

Step 2: Move d6 from peg a to peg b (on top of d5). Now peg a has d4 and d7. Peg b has d5, d6.

Step 3: Move d7 from peg a to peg b (on top of d6). But d6 is heavier than d7, so allowed. Now peg a has only d4. Peg b has d5, d6, d7. Peg c has d1, d2, d3.

Step 4: Move d4 from peg a to peg c. But peg c's top is d3. Since d4 is lighter than d3, we can place d4 on d3. Wait, no: the rule is a disk cannot be placed on a lighter disk. Wait, no, the rule is that a disk can't be moved onto another if it is heavier than it. So, placing a lighter disk on a heavier one is allowed. So d4 (lighter than d3) can be placed on d3. So step 4: move d4 to peg c, on top of d3. Now peg c has d1, d2, d3, d4.

Step 5: Now, we need to move d5 from peg b to peg c on top of d4. But peg b has d5, d6, d7. So we need to move d7 and d6 first.

Step 5a: Move d7 from peg b to peg a (empty now). Step 5b: Move d6 from peg b to peg a. Step 5c: Move d5 from peg b to peg c (on top of d4). Then move d6 and d7 back onto d5.

But let's see:

After step 4, peg c has d1, d2, d3, d4. Peg b has d5, d6, d7. Peg a is empty.

To move d5 to peg c, we need to move d7 and d6 off peg b. So:

Step 5: Move d7 from peg b to peg a. Now peg a has d7. Step 6: Move d6 from peg b to peg a (on top of d7). But d6 is heavier than d7, so can't do that. So need to move d7 to another peg first. Wait, peg a is empty except after moving d7 there. So step 5: move d7 to peg a. Step 6: move d6 to peg a? No, because d7 is lighter. So we need to move d6 to a different peg. The only available pegs are a and c. But peg c has d4. So moving d6 to peg c would place it on d4. Since d6 is lighter than d4, that's allowed. Wait, d6 is lighter than d4, so placing d6 on d4 is okay. So step 6: move d6 from peg b to peg c (on d4). But peg c currently has d4 on top. So moving d6 there would make peg c's stack d1, d2, d3, d4, d6. Then step 7: move d5 from peg b to peg c (on d6). But d5 is heavier than d6, so that's not allowed. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternative approach: Use peg a as temporary storage for the smaller disks while moving the larger ones. Let's try again.

After step 4: peg c has d1-d4, peg a is empty, peg b has d5, d6, d7.

We need to get d5 onto peg c. To do that, we need to move d6 and d7 from peg b to somewhere else. Since d5 is under them, but wait, peg b has d5 with d6 and d7 on top? Wait, no: after step 4, peg b had d5, d6, d7. But initially, d5 was on peg b with d7 on top. Then we moved d6 to peg b on top of d5 (step 2), but that's not correct. Wait, let's retrace:

Wait earlier steps:

Original setup:

peg a: d4, d6

peg b: d5, d7

peg c: d1, d2, d3

Step 1: move d7 from peg b to peg a (on d6). Now peg a: d4, d6, d7; peg b: d5.

Step 2: move d6 from peg a to peg b (on d5). Now peg a: d4, d7; peg b: d5, d6.

Step 3: move d7 from peg a to peg b (on d6). Now peg a: d4; peg b: d5, d6, d7.

Step 4: move d4 from peg a to peg c (on d3). Now peg c: d1, d2, d3, d4.

Now, to move d5 to peg c, we need to clear peg b's stack. The stack on peg b is d5 (bottom), d6, d7. So we need to move d7 and d6 off.

Step 5: move d7 from peg b to peg a (empty). Now peg a has d7; peg b has d5, d6.

Step 6: move d6 from peg b to peg a (on d7). But d6 is heavier than d7, so not allowed. So can't do that. So alternative: move d6 to peg c. peg c has d4 on top. d6 is lighter than d4, so allowed. So step 6: move d6 from peg b to peg c (on d4). Now peg c: d1, d2, d3, d4, d6. peg b has d5.

Step 7: move d5 from peg b to peg c (on d6). But d5 is heavier than d6 (since d5 > d6), so cannot place d5 on d6. So that's invalid. So this approach doesn't work.

Hmm. Maybe need to move d5 first, but how? Since d5 is under d6 and d7. Wait, after step 4, peg b has d5, d6, d7. So to move d5, we need to first move d7 and d6. But moving d7 is easy, but moving d6 requires moving d7 first.

Let me try again:

After step 4: peg c has d1-d4. peg b has d5, d6, d7.

Step 5: move d7 from peg b to peg a.

Step 6: move d6 from peg b to peg a. But d7 is on peg a, and d6 is heavier than d7, so can't place d6 on d7. So step 6 is invalid. So need to move d6 elsewhere. Where? peg c has d4. So step 6: move d6 to peg c (on d4). Allowed because d4 is heavier. Now peg c has d1-d4, d6. peg b has d5. peg a has d7.

Step 7: move d5 from peg b to peg c (on d6). But d5 is heavier than d6, so invalid. So stuck again.

Alternative idea: Maybe we need to use peg a as temporary storage for d5's stack. Let's try:

After step 4 (peg c has d1-d4, peg b has d5, d6, d7), let's move d7 to peg a, then d6 to peg a (but can't), so instead move d7 to peg a, then d6 to peg c, then d5 to peg c. Wait:

Step 5: move d7 from peg b to peg a.

Step 6: move d6 from peg b to peg c (on d4). Allowed.

Now peg c has d1-d4, d6. peg b has d5.

Step 7: move d5 from peg b to peg c (on d6). Not allowed.

Alternatively, move d5 to peg a:

Step 7: move d5 from peg b to peg a (on d7). But d5 is heavier than d7, so cannot place on d7. So need to move d7 first.

Step 5: move d7 to peg a.

Step 6: move d5 from peg b to peg a. No, because d7 is on peg a, and d5 is heavier than d7. So can't place d5 on d7. So need to move d7 to another peg first.

Step 5: move d7 from peg b to peg c. But peg c has d4 on top. d7 is lighter than d4, so allowed. Now peg c has d1-d4, d7. peg b has d5, d6.

Step 6: move d6 from peg b to peg c (on d7). But d6 is heavier than d7, so invalid. So no.

This is getting really tricky. Maybe a different approach: instead of moving d4 first, focus on moving d5 first. Let's see.

But d5 is under d7 on peg b. So to move d5, we need to move d7 first. Let's try:

Step 1: move d7 from peg b to peg c (on d3). Now peg c has d1, d2, d3, d7.

Step 2: move d5 from peg b to peg a. But peg a has d4 and d6. The top is d6. d5 is heavier than d6, so placing d5 on d6 is allowed? Wait, no: d5 is heavier than d6, so placing d5 on d6 would violate the rule. So can't do that. Therefore, need to clear peg a first.

To move d5 to peg a, we need to move d6 and d4. But that's back to the original problem.

Alternative idea: Move d7 to peg a instead of c.

Step 1: move d7 from peg b to peg a (on d6). Allowed because d6 is heavier. Now peg a has d4, d6, d7.

Step 2: move d6 from peg a to peg b (on d5). Allowed because d5 is heavier. Now peg a has d4, d7.

Step 3: move d7 from peg a to peg b (on d6). Allowed because d6 is heavier. Now peg a has d4. peg b has d5, d6, d7.

Step 4: move d4 from peg a to peg c (on d3). Allowed because d3 is heavier. Now peg c has d1, d2, d3, d4.

Now we need to move d5 from peg b to peg c. But peg b has d5, d6, d7. So need to move d7 and d6 first.

Step 5: move d7 from peg b to peg a. peg a now has d7.

Step 6: move d6 from peg b to peg a (on d7). Not allowed, since d6 is heavier. So move d6 to peg c (on d4). Allowed because d4 is heavier.

Now peg c has d1-d4, d6. peg b has d5. peg a has d7.

Step 7: move d5 from peg b to peg c (on d6). Not allowed (d5 > d6). So stuck again.

This is really challenging. Maybe we need to move both d4 and d5 to peg c, but the intermediate steps require moving the lighter disks around. Let's think recursively. The problem requires moving d4, d5, d6, d7 to peg c. But to move d4, we need to move d6; to move d5, we need to move d7. Then after moving d4 and d5, we need to move d6 and d7 on top of them.

Wait, maybe consider that d4 and d5 are like the next two disks to move, but they are each under their own lighter disks. So perhaps the process is:

1. Move d6 and d7 to temporary pegs.

2. Move d4 and d5 to peg c.

3. Then move d6 and d7 on top.

But how?

Let me try:

Step 1: Move d7 from peg b to peg c (on d3). Now peg c has d3, d7.

Step 2: Move d6 from peg a to peg b (on d5). But peg a has d4 and d6. So move d6 to peg b on d5. Allowed since d5 is heavier. Now peg a has d4.

Step 3: Move d5 from peg b to peg a. Wait, peg b now has d5 and d6. To move d5, we need to move d6 first. So step 3: move d6 from peg b to peg c (on d7). But d6 is heavier than d7, so can't. Alternatively, move d6 to peg a (on d4). Allowed since d4 is heavier. So step 3: move d6 to peg a (on d4). Now peg a has d4, d6.

Step 4: Now, peg b has only d5. So move d5 from peg b to peg c (on d7). But d5 is heavier than d7, so can't. So this approach isn't working.

Alternative approach inspired by Tower of Hanoi: To move n disks, you need to move the top n-1 to a temporary peg, move the bottom one, then move the n-1 back. But here, the initial configuration is split, so maybe we have two separate towers to move: the d4-d6 on peg a and d5-d7 on peg b.

Let's treat moving d4 to peg c as a subproblem. To move d4, we need to move d6. To move d6, where? Since d6 is lighter than d3, we can move it to peg c. But if we do that, then d4 can be moved to peg c. Wait, no: moving d6 to peg c (on d3) would allow us to move d4 to peg c, but d4 is heavier than d6, so we can't place d4 on d6. So we need to move d6 to a different peg.

Let me try:

Step 1: Move d6 from peg a (on d4) to peg b (on top of d7). But d6 is heavier than d7, so can't. So step 1: move d7 from peg b to peg a (on d6). Now peg a has d4, d6, d7. peg b has d5.

Step 2: Move d6 from peg a to peg b (on d5). Allowed since d5 is heavier. Now peg a has d4, d7. peg b has d5, d6.

Step 3: Move d7 from peg a to peg b (on d6). Allowed since d6 is heavier. Now peg a has d4. peg b has d5, d6, d7.

Step 4: Move d4 from peg a to peg c (on d3). Allowed. Now peg c has d1-d4. peg b has d5, d6, d7.

Now, we need to move d5 to peg c. To do that, we need to move d7 and d6 from peg b.

Step 5: Move d7 from peg b to peg a. peg a now has d7.

Step 6: Move d6 from peg b to peg a (on d7). Not allowed (d6 > d7). So step 6: move d6 to peg c (on d4). Allowed since d4 is heavier. Now peg c has d1-d4, d6. peg b has d5.

Step 7: Move d5 from peg b to peg c (on d6). Not allowed (d5 > d6). So stuck again.

This seems to be a recurring issue. The problem is that after moving d4 to peg c, we can't move d5 because it's under d6 and d7, and moving them requires placing them on lighter disks. Maybe we need to move d5 before d4. Let's see:

Alternative approach: Move d5 first.

But d5 is under d7 on peg b. So need to move d7 first.

Step 1: Move d7 from peg b to peg c (on d3). Now peg c has d1-d3, d7.

Step 2: Move d5 from peg b to peg a (on d4). But peg a has d4 and d6. So moving d5 to peg a would require placing it on d6. But d5 is heavier than d6, so can't. So need to move d6 first.

Step 2: Move d6 from peg a to peg b (now empty except d5). Wait, peg b has d5 after moving d7. Wait, after step 1, peg b has only d5. So step 2: move d6 from peg a (on d4) to peg b (on d5). Allowed since d5 is heavier. Now peg a has d4. peg b has d5, d6.

Step 3: Move d5 from peg b to peg c (on d7). But d5 is heavier than d7, so can't. So need to move d7 first.

Step 3: Move d7 from peg c to peg a (on d4). Allowed since d4 is heavier. Now peg a has d4, d7. peg c has d1-d3.

Step 4: Move d5 from peg b to peg c (on d3). Allowed since d3 is heavier. Now peg c has d1-d3, d5.

Step 5: Move d6 from peg b to peg c (on d5). Allowed since d5 is heavier. Now peg c has d1-d3, d5, d6.

Step 6: Move d7 from peg a to peg c (on d6). Allowed since d6 is heavier. Now peg c has d1-d3, d5, d6, d7.

But now we still have d4 on peg a. So we need to move d4 to peg c. But peg c's top is d7. d4 is heavier than d7, so can't place on d7. So need to move d7, d6, d5, d3 off. This seems worse.

This approach isn't working. I'm clearly missing something here. Maybe the key is to realize that the existing stack on peg c (d1, d2, d3) can be used as a temporary holding area for some disks. For example, since d3 is heavier than all other disks except d1 and d2, we can use peg c to temporarily hold some disks on top of d3.

Wait, but when we move a disk to peg c, we have to place it on top of the current top disk. So if we move d4 to peg c, we have to put it on d3. Then, if we need to move d4 later, we have to move whatever is on top of it first. But perhaps that's manageable.

Let's try a different strategy. Since d4, d5, d6, d7 need to be on peg c in order, and they are currently on pegs a and b, maybe the steps are:

1. Move d6 and d7 to a temporary peg (maybe peg b) to free up d4 and d5.

2. Move d4 and d5 to peg c.

3. Then move d6 and d7 on top of them.

But how to execute this.

Starting over:

Initial state:

- c: d1, d2, d3

- a: d4, d6

- b: d5, d7

Goal: all on c in order d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7.

Step 1: Move d7 from b to c. Now c has d1, d2, d3, d7.

Step 2: Move d6 from a to b (on d5). Allowed since d5 is heavier. Now a has d4, b has d5, d6.

Step 3: Move d5 from b to c. But peg b has d6 on top. Can't move d5 until d6 is moved. So step 3: move d6 from b to a. Now a has d4, d6. b has d5.

Step 4: Move d5 from b to c (on d7). Not allowed since d5 is heavier than d7. So step 4: move d7 from c to a (on d6). Allowed since d6 is heavier. Now c has d1-d3. a has d4, d6, d7. b has d5.

Step 5: Move d5 from b to c (on d3). Allowed. Now c has d1-d3, d5.

Step 6: Move d6 from a to c (on d5). Allowed since d5 is heavier. Now c has d1-d3, d5, d6. a has d4, d7.

Step 7: Move d7 from a to c (on d6). Allowed. Now c has d1-d3, d5, d6, d7. a has d4.

Step 8: Move d4 from a to c (on d7). Not allowed, since d4 is heavier than d7. So stuck again.

This approach also doesn't work. The recurring problem is that moving d4 after moving lighter disks results in it being blocked. So perhaps we need to move d4 first, then d5, but both are under other disks. Let's try:

Step 1: Move d6 from a to another peg. Let's move it to b. But peg b has d5 and d7. d6 is heavier than d7, so can't place on d7. So move d7 first.

Step 1: Move d7 from b to c (on d3). Now c has d1-d3, d7.

Step 2: Move d6 from a to b (on d5). Allowed since d5 is heavier. Now a has d4. b has d5, d6.

Step 3: Move d4 from a to c (on d7). Not allowed since d4 is heavier than d7. So need to move d7 first.

Step 3: Move d7 from c to a. Now a has d7. c has d1-d3.

Step 4: Move d4 from a to c (on d3). Allowed. Now c has d1-d3, d4. a has d7.

Step 5: Move d5 from b to c (on d4). To do that, need to move d6 first.

Step 5a: Move d6 from b to a (on d7). Not allowed (d6 > d7). So move d6 to c (on d4). Allowed since d4 is heavier.

Step 5: Move d6 from b to c (on d4). Now c has d1-d4, d6. b has d5.

Step 6: Move d5 from b to c (on d6). Not allowed (d5 > d6). Stuck again.

This is incredibly frustrating. I must be missing a key insight here. Let's think about the fact that we need to place d4, d5, d6, d7 in order on peg c. The existing stack on c has d1, d2, d3. So after those, we need d4. To place d4 on d3, we need to move d6 and d7 out of the way. Similarly, to place d5 on d4, we need to move d6 and d7. Let's consider using peg b as temporary storage for d6 and d7 while we move d4 and d5.

Step 1: Move d7 from peg b to peg a. Now peg a has d4, d6, d7. peg b has d5.

Step 2: Move d6 from peg a to peg b (on d5). Allowed. Now peg a has d4, d7. peg b has d5, d6.

Step 3: Move d7 from peg a to peg b (on d6). Allowed. Now peg a has d4. peg b has d5, d6, d7.

Step 4: Move d4 from peg a to peg c (on d3). Allowed. Now peg c has d1-d4. peg b has d5, d6, d7.

Now, to move d5 to peg c, we need to move d6 and d7 from peg b.

Step 5: Move d7 from peg b to peg a. Now peg a has d7.

Step 6: Move d6 from peg b to peg a (on d7). Not allowed (d6 > d7). So move d6 to peg c (on d4). Allowed. Now peg c has d1-d4, d6. peg b has d5.

Step 7: Move d5 from peg b to peg c (on d6). Not allowed (d5 > d6). Stuck again.

This seems like a loop. The only way to move d5 is to have it placed on a heavier disk. The only heavier disks available are d1-d4, which are on peg c. But d4 is already under d6. So unless we can move d6 away, we can't place d5 on d4. But to move d6 away, we need to move d5 first.

This suggests that the approach of moving d4 first is flawed. Maybe we need to move d5 first, but how?

Alternative plan inspired by standard Tower of Hanoi: Since we need to stack d4, d5, d6, d7 on top of d3, and these are the four lightest disks, perhaps we can treat this as a Tower of Hanoi problem with four disks (d4, d5, d6, d7) needing to move from pegs a and b to peg c.

But in the standard problem, all disks start on one peg. Here, they are split between a and b. So we need a way to combine them. Maybe move the disks from a and b to a single temporary peg, then move them to c. But given the constraints, this might not be straightforward.

Wait, d4 is on a with d6 on top. d5 is on b with d7 on top. So, the four disks are in two separate towers. To combine them, perhaps we need to move d6 and d7 to one peg, then move d4 and d5 to another, then build the tower.

But how? Let's try:

Step 1: Move d7 from b to a (on d6). Allowed. Now a has d4, d6, d7. b has d5.

Step 2: Move d6 from a to b (on d5). Allowed. Now a has d4, d7. b has d5, d6.

Step 3: Move d7 from a to b (on d6). Allowed. Now a has d4. b has d5, d6, d7.

Step 4: Move d4 from a to c (on d3). Allowed. Now c has d1-d4.

Step 5: Now, we need to move d5, d6, d7 to c. This is a Tower of Hanoi problem with three disks (d5, d6, d7) on peg b, needing to move to peg c using peg a as temporary.

But peg a is empty. So:

Step 5a: Move d7 from b to a.

Step 5b: Move d6 from b to c (on d4). Allowed.

Step 5c: Move d7 from a to c (on d6). Allowed.

Step 5d: Move d5 from b to a.

Step 5e: Move d7 from c to a (on d5). Not allowed (d7 < d5, so allowed to place d7 on d5? Wait, d5 is heavier than d7, so yes.

Step 5f: Move d6 from c to a (on d7). Not allowed (d6 > d7). So this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, after step 4:

peg c: d1-d4.

peg b: d5, d6, d7.

We need to move d5, d6, d7 to c on top of d4.

Standard Tower of Hanoi steps for three disks:

Move d7 to a.

Move d6 to c.

Move d7 to c.

Move d5 to c.

Move d7 to b.

Move d6 to c.

Move d7 to c.

But adapting:

Step 5a: Move d7 from b to a.

Step 5b: Move d6 from b to c (on d4). Allowed.

Step 5c: Move d7 from a to c (on d6). Allowed.

Now peg c has d1-d4, d6, d7. peg b has d5.

Step 5d: Move d5 from b to c (on d7). Not allowed (d5 > d7). So stuck.

Alternatively, after step 5c, we have d7 on c. To move d5 to c, need to move d7 and d6. So:

Step 5d: Move d7 from c to b.

Step 5e: Move d6 from c to a.

Step 5f: Move d7 from b to a (on d6). Not allowed (d7 < d6, so allowed).

Step 5g: Move d5 from b to c (on d4). Allowed.

Now peg c has d1-d4, d5. peg a has d6, d7.

Step 5h: Move d7 from a to c (on d5). Allowed.

Step 5i: Move d6 from a to c (on d7). Not allowed (d6 > d7). So need to move d7 first.

Step 5j: Move d7 from c to b.

Step 5k: Move d6 from a to c (on d5). Allowed.

Step 5l: Move d7 from b to c (on d6). Allowed.

Finally, all disks are on peg c: d1-d4, d5, d6, d7.

But this involves many steps. Let's outline the entire sequence from the beginning:

1. Move d7 from b to a (on d6).

2. Move d6 from a to b (on d5).

3. Move d7 from a to b (on d6).

4. Move d4 from a to c (on d3).

5. Move d7 from b to a.

6. Move d6 from b to c (on d4).

7. Move d7 from a to c (on d6).

8. Move d5 from b to a.

9. Move d7 from c to a (on d5).

10. Move d6 from c to a (on d7). — Wait, d6 > d7, so invalid. So need to adjust.

Alternatively, after step 7:

peg c: d1-d4, d6, d7.

peg b: empty except d5.

But d5 is supposed to be on peg b. Wait, no: after step 4, d5 is on peg b. Then step 5: move d7 from b to a (now peg b has d5, d6? Wait, no: after step 3, peg b has d5, d6, d7. Then step 4: move d4 to c. Then step 5: move d7 from b to a. Now peg b has d5, d6. Then step 6: move d6 from b to c. Now peg b has d5. So after step 7: peg c has d1-d4, d6, d7. peg b has d5. peg a has d7 from step 5? Wait, this is getting too confused. Maybe I need to write each step clearly.

Let me start over and write each step carefully:

Initial state:

- c: d1, d2, d3

- a: d4, d6

- b: d5, d7

Step 1: Move d7 from b to a (on d6). Now a has d4, d6, d7; b has d5.

Step 2: Move d6 from a to b (on d5). Now a has d4, d7; b has d5, d6.

Step 3: Move d7 from a to b (on d6). Now a has d4; b has d5, d6, d7.

Step 4: Move d4 from a to c (on d3). Now c has d1-d4; b has d5, d6, d7.

Step 5: Move d7 from b to a. Now a has d7; b has d5, d6.

Step 6: Move d6 from b to c (on d4). Now c has d1-d4, d6; b has d5.

Step 7: Move d7 from a to c (on d6). Now c has d1-d4, d6, d7; b has d5.

Step 8: Move d5 from b to a. Now a has d5, d7; b is empty.

Step 9: Move d7 from a to c (on d7 is already there). Wait, no. peg c has d7 on top. So step 8: move d5 from b to a. Now a has d5, d7? No, step 8: a has d7 from step 5. Moving d5 to a would place it on d7. d5 is heavier than d7, so invalid. So step 8 is invalid.

This shows that my step-by-step is flawed. Let's correct it.

After step 7: peg a has d7 (moved there in step 5), peg b has d5, and peg c has d1-d4, d6, d7.

Wait, no. Step 7: move d7 from a to c. After step 7, peg a is empty, peg c has d7 on top of d6. So step 8: move d5 from b to a. Now a has d5; b is empty; peg c has d1-d4, d6, d7.

Step 9: Move d6 from c to a (on d5). Allowed. Now peg a has d5, d6; peg c has d1-d4, d7.

Step 10: Move d7 from c to a (on d6). Allowed. Now peg a has d5, d6, d7; peg c has d1-d4.

Step 11: Move d5 from a to c (on d4). Allowed. Now peg c has d1-d4, d5.

Step 12: Move d6 from a to c (on d5). Allowed.

Step 13: Move d7 from a to c (on d6). Allowed.

Now all disks are on peg c: d1-d7 in order.

This seems to work, but let's verify each step:

1. Move d7 from b to a (allowed: d7 is top of b, a's top is d6 which is heavier).

2. Move d6 from a to b (on d5, which is heavier).

3. Move d7 from a to b (on d6, which is heavier).

4. Move d4 from a to c (on d3, which is heavier).

5. Move d7 from b to a (now a has d7).

6. Move d6 from b to c (on d4, which is heavier).

7. Move d7 from a to c (on d6, which is heavier).

8. Move d5 from b to a (now a has d5).

9. Move d6 from c to a (on d5, which is heavier).

10. Move d7 from c to a (on d6, which is heavier).

11. Move d5 from a to c (on d4, which is heavier).

12. Move d6 from a to c (on d5, which is heavier).

13. Move d7 from a to c (on d6, which is heavier).

Yes, all moves are valid. This results in all disks on peg c in the correct order.

So the sequence of moves is:

1. Move d7 from b to a.

2. Move d6 from a to b.

3. Move d7 from a to b.

4. Move d4 from a to c.

5. Move d7 from b to a.

6. Move d6 from b to c.

7. Move d7 from a to c.

8. Move d5 from b to a.

9. Move d6 from c to a.

10. Move d7 from c to a.

11. Move d5 from a to c.

12. Move d6 from a to c.

13. Move d7 from a to c.

This should solve the problem. Let me check once more for any invalid steps.

Step 1: Valid (d7 to a on d6).

Step 2: Valid (d6 to b on d5).

Step 3: Valid (d7 to b on d6).

Step 4: Valid (d4 to c on d3).

Step 5: Valid (d7 from b to a).

Step 6: Valid (d6 from b to c on d4).

Step 7: Valid (d7 from a to c on d6).

Step 8: Valid (d5 from b to a).

Step 9: Valid (d6 from c to a on d5).

Step 10: Valid (d7 from c to a on d6).

Step 11: Valid (d5 from a to c on d4).

Step 12: Valid (d6 from a to c on d5).

Step 13: Valid (d7 from a to c on d6).

All steps are valid. This sequence successfully moves all disks to peg c in the correct order.

To stack all disks on peg c, follow these steps:

Move d7 from peg b to peg a. (Now peg a has d4, d6, d7; peg b has d5.)

Move d6 from peg a to peg b. (Peg b now has d5, d6; peg a has d4, d7.)

Move d7 from peg a to peg b. (Peg b now has d5, d6, d7; peg a has d4.)

Move d4 from peg a to peg c. (Peg c now has d1, d2, d3, d4.)

Move d7 from peg b to peg a. (Peg a has d7; peg b has d5, d6.)

Move d6 from peg b to peg c. (Peg c now has d1, d2, d3, d4, d6.)

Move d7 from peg a to peg c. (Peg c now has d1, d2, d3, d4, d6, d7.)

Move d5 from peg b to peg a. (Peg a has d5; peg b is empty.)

Move d6 from peg c to peg a. (Peg a now has d5, d6.)

Move d7 from peg c to peg a. (Peg a now has d5, d6, d7.)

Move d5 from peg a to peg c. (Peg c now has d1, d2, d3, d4, d5.)

Move d6 from peg a to peg c. (Peg c now has d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6.)

Move d7 from peg a to peg c. (All disks are now on peg c in order.)

Final State: Peg c has disks stacked as d1 (bottom), d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7 (top).
