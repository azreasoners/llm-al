The task involves stacking disks on pegs, with specific rules: disks can only be moved if nothing is on top of them, and you can't place a heavier disk on a lighter one. There are seven disks (d1 to d7) and three pegs (a, b, c). The disks are arranged by weight, with disk d1 being the heaviest and d7 the lightest. The goal is to stack them in an ordered manner, respecting the movement rules.

The goal is to stack all the disks on peg C in descending order, with d1 at the bottom and d7 at the top. In the initial setup, peg C has d1, d2, and d3 (with d3 on top). Peg A has d4 and d6, and peg B has d5 and d7. We can only move the top disk of any peg, and a disk can only land on a peg if that peg is either empty or the top disk is heavier. We need to plan moves carefully while adhering to these rules.

I need to stack the remaining disks (d4, d5, d6, d7) onto peg C, already holding d1, d2, and d3 in correct order. The rule is that a disk can only be placed on another if the destination disk is heavier. So, d4 can be placed on d3, as d3 is heavier. Similarly, d5 can be placed on d4, d6 on d5, and d7 on d6. I’ll plan moves carefully, making sure to use the other pegs temporarily, but not disturbing d1, d2, or d3 on peg C.

I need to be careful moving disks to achieve the correct order without violating the rules. Initially, peg C holds d1, d2, and d3 in order, while peg A holds d4 and d6, and peg B holds d5 and d7. The challenge is that I can’t move a larger disk on top of a smaller one. The general plan is to move disks around without disturbing the final order on peg C. This means temporarily using peg A or peg B for disk storage. I’ll move d7 from peg B to peg A, freeing up space.

We need to carefully move disks between pegs while preserving the final required order. To start, we must free d4 on peg A, but d6 is in the way. Moving d6 to peg C might temporarily block d4 but could be a step toward freeing up peg A. Following that, I’ll have to move disks around, clearing space in a way that allows peg C to eventually hold the correctly ordered stack. This plan will involve shifting d6 and controlling where d7 and d5 go to avoid disruptions.

The task is to move the disks between the pegs while preserving the correct order. I need to free d4 from peg A, but d6 is in the way. Moving d6 to peg B might work, but I must first handle d7 carefully, as d7 is lighter than d6. I'll move d7 first, then d6. Moving d7 onto peg B is allowed, then I’ll move d6 there, freeing peg A. After that, I'll move d4 to peg C, where things should finally line up correctly.

I’ve got to move the disks in the right order. After placing d4 onto peg c, I need to arrange d5, d6, and d7. Moving d7 from peg b to peg a seems to free up space. From there, I can shift d6 to peg c, but the peg needs to be in the right order. When placing d5 on top of peg c, I also have to make sure no lighter disks are blocking me. After more adjustments, the disks should stack correctly.

Below is one valid plan (with 14 moves) that obeys the rules:

Initial configuration:
• Peg c: bottom → d1, then d2, and top d3
• Peg a: bottom d4 with d6 on top
• Peg b: bottom d5 with d7 on top

Remember that a move is allowed only if (1) the disk you’re moving is on the top of its stack and (2) you can place it only on an empty peg or on top of a disk that is heavier than it.

The goal is to form the final stack on peg c in this order (bottom to top):
d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7

A working sequence is as follows:

Move 1: Move d7 from peg b to peg a.
  Result:
  – Peg a: d4, d6, d7 (top)
  – Peg b: d5
  – Peg c: d1, d2, d3

Move 2: Move d7 from peg a to peg b.
  Result:
  – Peg a: d4, d6
  – Peg b: d5, d7 (top)
  – Peg c: d1, d2, d3

Move 3: Move d6 from peg a to peg c.
  Check: Peg c’s top (d3) is heavier than d6.
  Result:
  – Peg a: d4
  – Peg b: d5, d7
  – Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d6

Move 4: Move d6 from peg c to peg a.
  Check: Peg a’s top (d4) is heavier than d6.
  Result:
  – Peg a: d4, d6
  – Peg b: d5, d7
  – Peg c: d1, d2, d3

Move 5: Move d7 from peg b to peg c.
  Check: Peg c’s top (d3) is heavier than d7.
  Result:
  – Peg a: d4, d6
  – Peg b: d5
  – Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d7

Move 6: Move d6 from peg a to peg b.
  Check: Peg b’s top (d5) is heavier than d6.
  Result:
  – Peg a: d4
  – Peg b: d5, d6, d7
  – Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d7 remains but note the top is still d7

Move 7: Move d7 from peg c to peg b.
  Check: Now peg b’s top is d6; since d6 is heavier than d7, the move is legal.
  Result:
  – Peg a: d4
  – Peg b: d5, d6, d7
  – Peg c: d1, d2, d3

Move 8: Move d4 from peg a to peg c.
  Check: Peg c’s top (d3) is heavier than d4.
  Result:
  – Peg a: (empty)
  – Peg b: d5, d6, d7
  – Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d4

Move 9: Move d7 from peg b to peg a.
  Result:
  – Peg a: d7
  – Peg b: d5, d6
  – Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d4

Move 10: Move d6 from peg b to peg c.
  Check: Peg c’s top (d4) is heavier than d6.
  Result:
  – Peg a: d7
  – Peg b: d5
  – Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d4, d6

Move 11: Move d6 from peg c to peg b.
  Check: Peg b’s top (d5) is heavier than d6.
  Result:
  – Peg a: d7
  – Peg b: d5, d6
  – Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d4

Move 12: Move d5 from peg b to peg c.
  Check: Peg c’s top (d4) is heavier than d5.
  Result:
  – Peg a: d7
  – Peg b: d6
  – Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d4, d5

Move 13: Move d6 from peg b to peg c.
  Check: Peg c’s top (d5) is heavier than d6.
  Result:
  – Peg a: d7
  – Peg b: (empty)
  – Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6

Move 14: Finally, move d7 from peg a to peg c.
  Check: Peg c’s top (d6) is heavier than d7.
  Result (final):
  – Peg a: (empty)
  – Peg b: (empty)
  – Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7

This sequence achieves the desired final tower on peg c while respecting the rule that a heavier disk cannot be placed on a lighter one.
