To solve this problem, which resembles a complex version of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, the goal is to move all disks to peg c while respecting the rules: a disk can only be moved if no other disks are on top of it, and a disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Hereâ€™s the initial setup:

Peg a: d4, d6
Peg b: d5, d7
Peg c: d1, d2, d3
The disks from heaviest to lightest are: d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7.

Step-by-Step Plan
Objective: Move all disks to peg c.

Prepare for Moves:
Move d7 from d5 to peg a.
Move d6 from d4 to peg b.
State:
Peg a: d4, d7
Peg b: d5, d6
Peg c: d1, d2, d3
Continue Preparation:
Move d5 from peg b to peg c.
State:
Peg a: d4, d7
Peg b: d6
Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d5
Rearrange Smaller Disks:
Move d7 from d4 to d6 (on peg b).
State:
Peg a: d4
Peg b: d6, d7
Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d5
Clearing Peg a:
Move d4 from peg a to peg c.
State:
Peg a:
Peg b: d6, d7
Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d5, d4
Final Arrangement:
Move d7 from d6 to d4 (on peg c).
Move d6 from peg b to peg c.
Final State:
Peg a:
Peg b:
Peg c: d1, d2, d3, d5, d4, d6, d7
This sequence will stack all disks in ascending order from bottom to top on peg c, following the rules of the puzzle. Each step ensures that no heavier disk is placed on a lighter disk and that disks are only moved when there is no disk on top of them.
