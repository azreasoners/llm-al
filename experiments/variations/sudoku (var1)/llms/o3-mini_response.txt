I'm given a Sudoku puzzle and need to fully solve it, filling in the 9x9 grid. The fixed clues for each row will guide me.

For example, in Row 0: col2 = 9, col4 = 2, col5 = 8, col6 = 7. Row 1: col0 = 8, col2 = 6, col5 = 4, col8 = 5. And so on.

Let's proceed by carefully filling in each row based on the clues provided. I'll use logic and Sudoku rules to deduce the missing numbers and complete the board.

I need to fully solve this puzzle row by row. Let's start with Row 0: we have missing values for columns c0, c1, c3, c7, c8. The numbers already used are {9, 2, 8, 7}, so the remaining numbers to use are {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

It looks like I should apply standard Sudoku-solving techniques, considering column and row constraints, to narrow down possibilities for each missing cell. I’ll systematically evaluate options, filling in each row while keeping all the Sudoku rules in mind.

We can begin by writing down the given clues on a 9×9 board. For example, using zero‐based row and column numbering the clues are:

Row 0: col2 = 9, col4 = 2, col5 = 8, col6 = 7
Row 1: col0 = 8, col2 = 6, col5 = 4, col8 = 5
Row 2: col2 = 3, col8 = 4
Row 3: col0 = 6
Row 4: col1 = 2, col3 = 7, col4 = 1, col5 = 3, col6 = 4, col7 = 5
Row 5: col8 = 2
Row 6: col0 = 3, col6 = 5
Row 7: col0 = 9, col3 = 4, col6 = 8, col8 = 7
Row 8: col2 = 1, col3 = 2, col4 = 5, col6 = 3
A correct Sudoku solution must fill every cell with a digit from 1 to 9 so that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids contains no repeated digits.

Now, let’s examine one particular row and column to see if the clues are consistent. Consider row 4 (the 5th row). The given digits in row 4 are:
 • Column 1: 2
 • Column 3: 7
 • Column 4: 1
 • Column 5: 3
 • Column 6: 4
 • Column 7: 5

Thus row 4 already contains {1,2,3,4,5,7} and is missing {6,8,9}.

Now, look at column 0. The given digits in column 0 are:
 • Row 1: 8
 • Row 3: 6
 • Row 6: 3
 • Row 7: 9

This means column 0 already contains {8,6,3,9} and can only accept one of {1,2,4,5,7} in its empty cells.

But one of the empty cells in column 0 is row 4, and from the row’s perspective it must be one of {6,8,9}—none of which appear in the allowed set for column 0. This is a direct contradiction. Because row 4, column 0 would have to satisfy both the row’s missing set ({6,8,9}) and the column’s allowed set ({1,2,4,5,7}), there is no digit that can go there.

Because at least one cell has no possible digit that meets the row, column, and 3×3 subgrid requirements, the clues as provided are inconsistent and the puzzle is unsolvable.

Answer: The provided clues lead to a contradiction. No complete Sudoku solution exists with these numbers.
