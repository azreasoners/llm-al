Explanation of the Solving Process (General Sudoku Strategies):

While I can't show every single deduction step-by-step (that would be very long), I'll outline the common strategies used in Sudoku solving, which would have been applied here:

Scanning: Look for rows, columns, or 3x3 boxes that are nearly full. This helps identify the missing numbers.

Cross-hatching: If a number appears multiple times in a row or column, it restricts where that number can go in intersecting rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes.

Candidate Elimination (Pencil Marks): Mentally (or with pencil marks on paper), list the possible candidates for each empty cell. As you fill in other cells, eliminate candidates from related cells.

Hidden Singles: If a number is a candidate for only one cell within a row, column, or 3x3 box, then that number must go in that cell.

Naked Pairs/Triples: If two or three cells in a row, column, or 3x3 box have the same two or three candidate numbers, then those numbers must be in those cells, and can be eliminated as candidates from other cells in that row, column, or box.

X-Wings/Swordfish: More advanced techniques that involve looking for patterns of candidate numbers across rows and columns.

Example of a simple deduction (using your puzzle):

Look at the top row. You have 9, 2, 8, and 7. The missing numbers are 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Now look at the first 3x3 box. It already contains a 3. So, the 3 in the top row must be in either the first or second cell. Looking at the first column, there is a 8 in the second row. So, the first cell in the top row must be 1.

By applying these strategies repeatedly, you can systematically fill in the grid until the solution is reached. Sudoku puzzles are designed to have only one unique solution.
