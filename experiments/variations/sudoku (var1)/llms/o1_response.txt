Thought about Sudoku constraints and solution for 1m 9s
Mapping Sudoku progress

I’m placing given numbers in the Sudoku grid and listing remaining gaps to solve. This step-by-step process helps identify missing values in each row.

Piecing together

I'm filling in the given entries into the Sudoku grid, identifying gaps, and strategizing to determine the missing numbers in each row. Progress is steady as the grid starts to take shape.

Noticing progress

Rows 6, 7, and 8 are filling in. The next step is to identify the constraints and systematically solve for the remaining values.

Piecing together constraints

I'm mapping row and column constraints to identify missing digits for each. This approach helps narrow down possibilities and move closer to a solution.

Pinpointing conflicts

I’m thinking through the placement of digits 6, 8, and 9 in row 4. The column 0 constraint reveals they’re already used, causing a conflict.

Spotting contradictions

Analyzing the digits in column 0, I noticed 6, 8, and 9 are already present in row 4, causing a contradiction with the missing digits identified earlier.

Verifying details

OK, let me see. I checked the puzzle and confirmed row 4, column 0 is empty. The missing digits for row 4 are definitely 6, 8, and 9.

Analyzing constraints

Column 0 contains 8, 6, 3, and 9, leaving 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 for row 4, column 0. This identifies a contradiction between column and row constraints.

Revisiting digit constraints

OK, let me see. Examining row 4's missing digits 6, 8, and 9 against column 0's existing digits 8, 6, 3, and 9.

Identifying a discrepancy

I'm mapping out that row 4, column 0 is empty, with conflicting constraints for the missing digits 6, 8, and 9. This particular puzzle seems unsolvable as presented.

Spotting a flaw

I’m digging into row 4, columns 6 and 7, and their impact on column 6. This leads me to think the puzzle might have an error or shifted rows.

Analyzing patterns

I’m cross-referencing the provided digits with known Sudoku puzzles to identify any recognizable patterns or configurations that could help solve this puzzle.

Utilizing a solver

I'm analyzing the provided Sudoku digits and considering a Sudoku solver to help fill in the remaining cells. This method should streamline the solution process.

Identifying contradictions

I’m noting conflicts in row 3, column 0, and the middle-left 3x3 box. This raises doubts about the puzzle's solvability, indicating a possible mistake in the problem setup.

Spotting inconsistency

I’m analyzing the contradiction between row and column constraints, indicating an error in the puzzle. This contradiction suggests no single solution can satisfy both constraints.

Analyzing the puzzle

I’m mapping out the likelihood of a puzzle error, given the contradiction between row 4, column 0. This suggests there might be a mistake in the problem's constraints.

Spotting patterns

I’m examining the rows for any digit duplicates, which could indicate a problem with the puzzle's setup or constraints. This is crucial to ensure the puzzle's integrity.

Examining columns

I’m noting that all digits in each column are unique, which suggests that the puzzle's contradiction likely stems from conflicting constraints, not from duplicates.

Revisiting the puzzle

I'm identifying a key conflict in the puzzle and considering if changing a digit could resolve the contradiction, allowing the puzzle to be solved.

Below is a concise way to see that the puzzle (as written) is actually inconsistent and cannot be completed. In other words, there is no valid Sudoku solution that satisfies all these givens simultaneously.

2. The contradiction in Row 4 vs. Column 0
Focus on Row 4 and Column 0:

In Row 4, the given digits are:

2
2 in column 1
7
7 in column 3
1
1 in column 4
3
3 in column 5
4
4 in column 6
5
5 in column 7
That means Row 4 already contains 
{
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
,
7
}
{1,2,3,4,5,7}.
The only missing digits for Row 4 are therefore 
{
6
,
8
,
9
}
{6,8,9}.

So the three unknown cells in Row 4 (namely 
(
4
,
0
)
,
(
4
,
2
)
,
(
4
,
8
)
(4,0),(4,2),(4,8)) must each be one of 
{
6
,
8
,
9
}
{6,8,9}.

Now look at Column 0. From the givens:

(
1
,
0
)
=
8
(1,0)=8
(
3
,
0
)
=
6
(3,0)=6
(
6
,
0
)
=
3
(6,0)=3
(
7
,
0
)
=
9
(7,0)=9
So Column 0 already has 
{
8
,
6
,
3
,
9
}
{8,6,3,9}.
That means the only missing digits for Column 0 are 
{
1
,
2
,
4
,
5
,
7
}
{1,2,4,5,7}.

The cell 
(
4
,
0
)
(4,0) (Row 4, Column 0) therefore must simultaneously satisfy:

“Row 4 missing set” = 
{
6
,
8
,
9
}
{6,8,9}
“Column 0 missing set” = 
{
1
,
2
,
4
,
5
,
7
}
{1,2,4,5,7}
But 
{
6
,
8
,
9
}
{6,8,9} and 
{
1
,
2
,
4
,
5
,
7
}
{1,2,4,5,7} have empty intersection—they share no common digit.

Hence 
(
4
,
0
)
(4,0) cannot be assigned any legal digit at all. This is a direct contradiction.

3. Conclusion
Because of the above clash, there is no way to fill the grid so that Row 4 and Column 0 can both be satisfied. In other words, the puzzle as stated has no solution. It is simply inconsistent.

If one of the givens were a typo (for example, if 
(
4
,
6
)
(4,6) were not actually 4), then a consistent solution might emerge. But with the puzzle exactly as written, it cannot be solved.
