It seems that I'm unable to access the required library to solve the Sudoku puzzle directly in this environment. However, I can provide you with a Python script that you can run in your own environment to solve the Sudoku puzzle. This script will use the Google OR-Tools library to model and solve the puzzle. Here's the script you can use:

python
Copy code
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

def solve_sudoku(initial_grid):
    # Create the model
    model = cp_model.CpModel()

    # Define the grid size
    grid_size = len(initial_grid)
    sub_grid_size = int(grid_size ** 0.5)

    # Create the variables: Sudoku cells must contain values between 0 and grid_size - 1 (0 to 8 here)
    cells = {
        (i, j): model.NewIntVar(0, grid_size - 1, f'cell_{i}_{j}')
        for i in range(grid_size) for j in range(grid_size)
    }

    # Fill in the initial values
    for i in range(grid_size):
        for j in range(grid_size):
            if initial_grid[i][j] != -1:  # -1 indicates an empty cell
                model.Add(cells[i, j] == initial_grid[i][j])

    # Each row must contain different values
    for i in range(grid_size):
        model.AddAllDifferent([cells[i, j] for j in range(grid_size)])

    # Each column must contain different values
    for j in range(grid_size):
        model.AddAllDifferent([cells[i, j] for i in range(grid_size)])

    # Each subgrid must contain different values
    for box_i in range(sub_grid_size):
        for box_j in range(sub_grid_size):
            model.AddAllDifferent([
                cells[i, j]
                for i in range(box_i * sub_grid_size, (box_i + 1) * sub_grid_size)
                for j in range(box_j * sub_grid_size, (box_j + 1) * sub_grid_size)
            ])

    # Create the solver and solve the model
    solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
    status = solver.Solve(model)

    if status == cp_model.FEASIBLE:
        return [[solver.Value(cells[i, j]) for j in range(grid_size)] for i in range(grid_size)]
    else:
        return None

# The initial Sudoku grid (fill in your values or use an example)
initial_grid = [
    [-1, -1,  8, -1,  1,  7,  6, -1, -1],
    [ 7, -1,  5, -1, -1,  3, -1, -1,  4],
    [-1, -1,  2, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1,  3],
    [ 5, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],
    [-1,  1, -1,  6,  0,  2,  3,  4, -1],
    [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1,  1],
    [ 2, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1,  4, -1, -1],
    [ 8, -1, -1,  3, -1, -1,  7, -1,  6],
    [-1, -1,  0,  1,  4, -1,  2, -1, -1]
]

solution = solve_sudoku(initial_grid)
if solution:
    for row in solution:
        print(row)
else:
    print("No solution found.")
To run this script, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer along with the ortools package, which you can install using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install ortools
Let me know if you need further help or any modifications to the script! â€‹
