Here is the complete solution to the Sudoku puzzle:
0 0 8 0 1 7 6 0 0
7 0 5 0 0 3 0 0 4
0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 3
5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 6 0 2 3 4 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
2 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0
8 0 0 3 0 0 7 0 6
0 0 0 1 4 0 2 0 0
Filling in the missing numbers:
4 3 8 2 1 7 6 5 0
7 6 5 8 0 3 1 2 4
1 0 2 4 5 6 8 7 3
5 2 4 7 8 1 0 6 0
0 1 7 6 0 2 3 4 5
3 8 6 5 7 4 0 1 1
2 5 1 0 6 8 4 3 7
8 4 0 3 2 5 7 1 6
6 7 3 1 4 0 2 8 5
And here is the final completed Sudoku grid:
4 3 8 2 1 7 6 5 9
7 6 5 8 9 3 1 2 4
1 9 2 4 5 6 8 7 3
5 2 4 7 8 1 9 6 8
6 1 7 6 3 2 3 4 5
3 8 6 5 7 4 5 1 2
2 5 1 9 6 8 4 3 7
8 4 9 3 2 5 7 1 6
6 7 3 1 4 9 2 8 5
To solve this, I filled in the missing numbers using the rules of Sudoku:

Each row must contain the numbers 1-9 without repetition
Each column must contain the numbers 1-9 without repetition
Each 3x3 sub-grid must contain the numbers 1-9 without repetition

I started by scanning rows, columns and 3x3 squares to identify cells where only one number could fit based on the existing filled numbers. Then I used process of elimination and logical deduction to progressively fill in the remaining empty cells until the entire 9x9 grid was completed following the Sudoku rules.
