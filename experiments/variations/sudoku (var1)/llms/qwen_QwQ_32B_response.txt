So I've got this Sudoku puzzle to solve. I'm not super experienced with Sudoku, but I know the basics. The goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, making sure that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repeating any.

The problem gives me some starting points:

- Row 0: column 2 is 9, column 4 is 2, column 5 is 8, column 6 is 7

- Row 1: column 0 is 8, column 2 is 6, column 5 is 4, column 8 is 5

- Row 2: column 2 is 3, column 8 is 4

- Row 3: column 0 is 6

- Row 4: column 1 is 2, column 3 is 7, column 4 is 1, column 5 is 3, column 6 is 4, column 7 is 5

- Row 5: column 8 is 2

- Row 6: column 0 is 3, column 6 is 5

- Row 7: column 0 is 9, column 3 is 4, column 6 is 8, column 8 is 7

- Row 8: column 2 is 1, column 3 is 2, column 4 is 5, column 6 is 3

Alright, let's try to visualize this grid. I'll sketch it out:

Row 0: _  _  9  _  2  8  7  _  _

Row 1: 8  _  6  _  _  4  _  _  5

Row 2: _  _  3  _  _  _  _  _  4

Row 3: 6  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _

Row 4: _  2  _  7  1  3  4  5  _

Row 5: _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  2

Row 6: 3  _  _  _  _  _  5  _  _

Row 7: 9  _  _  4  _  _  8  _  7

Row 8: _  _  1  2  5  _  3  _  _

Hmm, that's a lot of empty spaces. I need to fill in the blanks while making sure that no number repeats in any row, column, or 3x3 box.

I think I'll start with the rows that have the most given numbers, as they might be easier to fill out first.

Looking at row 0: _  _  9  _  2  8  7  _  _

We already have 9, 2, 8, and 7. So, the missing numbers are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and perhaps another number. Wait, let's check: 1 to 9 must be present, but some might be in other rows and columns.

Actually, in Sudoku, each row must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once. So, in row 0, we have 9,2,8,7, and need to fill in the rest.

Wait, actually, looking back, row 0 has positions 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Given: column 2 is 9, column 4 is 2, column 5 is 8, column 6 is 7.

So, row 0: _  _  9  _  2  8  7  _  _

So, positions 0,1,3,7,8 are empty.

So, the missing numbers are 1,3,4,5,6,9, but 9 is already in position 2, so 1,3,4,5,6.

Wait, no: wait, 9 is already in position 2, so it can't be repeated in the row.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake. In Sudoku, each number from 1 to 9 must appear exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 box.

So, in row 0, we have 9,2,8,7, and need to fill in the remaining positions with the numbers that are not yet in the row.

But 9 is already used, so it can't appear again in the row.

Wait, but the problem says "possible numbers are 1-9", and constraints are no repeats in row, column, or 3x3 box.

So, for row 0, we have 9,2,8,7, and need to place 1,3,4,5,6 in the empty positions.

But, we have to consider the constraints from columns and boxes as well.

Maybe I should look at the 3x3 boxes to see what numbers are already present.

Let me divide the grid into 3x3 boxes.

Box 0: rows 0-2, columns 0-2

Box 1: rows 0-2, columns 3-5

Box 2: rows 0-2, columns 6-8

Box 3: rows 3-5, columns 0-2

Box 4: rows 3-5, columns 3-5

Box 5: rows 3-5, columns 6-8

Box 6: rows 6-8, columns 0-2

Box 7: rows 6-8, columns 3-5

Box 8: rows 6-8, columns 6-8

Alright, let's consider box 0: rows 0-2, columns 0-2.

Given:

Row 0: column 0 is _, column 1 is _, column 2 is 9

Row 1: column 0 is 8, column 1 is _, column 2 is 6

Row 2: column 0 is _, column 1 is _, column 2 is 3

So, in box 0, we have numbers 9,8,6,3.

Therefore, the missing numbers in box 0 are 1,2,4,5,7.

But, in row 0, positions 0 and 1 are in box 0, and need to be filled with numbers not already in row 0 or box 0.

Wait, row 0 has 9,2,8,7, so missing 1,3,4,5,6.

But box 0 has 9,8,6,3, so the possible numbers for row 0, positions 0 and 1, must not be in box 0.

So, possible numbers for row 0, pos 0 and 1: 1,3,4,5, but 3 is already in box 0, so 1,4,5.

Wait, no: wait, box 0 has 9,8,6,3.

So, possible numbers for box 0 are 1,2,4,5,7.

But, for row 0, positions 0 and 1, we need numbers that are in both the missing row numbers and the missing box numbers.

Row 0 missing: 1,3,4,5,6

Box 0 missing: 1,2,4,5,7

Intersection: 1,4,5

So, possible numbers for row 0, positions 0 and 1: 1,4,5

Similarly, position 3 in row 0 is in box 1.

Box 1: rows 0-2, columns 3-5

Given:

Row 0: column 3 is _, column 4 is 2, column 5 is 8

Row 1: column 3 is _, column 4 is _, column 5 is 4

Row 2: column 3 is _, column 4 is _, column 5 is _

So, in box 1, we have 2,8,4

Therefore, missing numbers in box 1: 1,3,5,6,7,9

But, row 0 missing: 1,3,4,5,6

Intersection: 1,3,4,5,6

But position 3 in row 0 is in box 1, so possible numbers are intersection of row missing and box missing: 1,3,4,5,6

Wait, but box 1 missing is 1,3,5,6,7,9

Intersection with row missing (1,3,4,5,6): 1,3,5,6

So, possible numbers for row 0, position 3: 1,3,5,6

Similarly, position 7 in row 0 is in box 2.

Box 2: rows 0-2, columns 6-8

Given:

Row 0: column 6 is 7, column 7 is _, column 8 is _

Row 1: column 6 is _, column 7 is _, column 8 is 5

Row 2: column 6 is _, column 7 is _, column 8 is 4

So, in box 2, we have 7,5,4

Missing numbers: 1,2,3,6,8,9

Row 0 missing: 1,3,4,5,6

Intersection: 1,3,6

So, possible numbers for row 0, position 7: 1,3,6

And position 8 in row 0 is in box 2.

Possible numbers: intersection of row missing (1,3,4,5,6) and box missing (1,2,3,6,8,9): 1,3,6

So, for row 0:

Pos 0: 1,4,5

Pos 1: 1,4,5

Pos 2: 9 (given)

Pos 3: 1,3,5,6

Pos 4: 2 (given)

Pos 5: 8 (given)

Pos 6: 7 (given)

Pos 7: 1,3,6

Pos 8: 1,3,6

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Maybe I should look at another row that has more given numbers.

Let's look at row 4: _ 2 _ 7 1 3 4 5 _

Row 4 has positions 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Given: position 1 is 2, position 3 is 7, position 4 is 1, position 5 is 3, position 6 is 4, position 7 is 5.

So, row 4: _ 2 _ 7 1 3 4 5 _

Missing numbers: 6,8,9

Positions 0,2,8 are empty.

So, positions 0,2,8 must be 6,8,9 in some order.

Now, let's see the constraints from columns and boxes.

Position 0 in row 4 is in column 0 and box 3.

Column 0: rows 0 to 8.

Given:

Row 0: _

Row 1: 8

Row 2: _

Row 3: 6

Row 4: _

Row 5: _

Row 6: 3

Row 7: 9

Row 8: _

So, in column 0, we have 8,6,3,9.

Therefore, missing numbers in column 0: 1,2,4,5,7

But, for row 4, position 0, possible numbers are 6,8,9, but 6 and 9 are already in column 0, so only 8 is possible.

Wait, but row 4 position 0 can only be 8.

Because 6 and 9 are already in column 0.

Wait, row 5 and row 2 have no numbers in column 0 yet, but 6 and 9 are already used in column 0 in rows 3 and 7.

Wait, row 3: 6

Row 7: 9

So, in column 0, 6 and 9 are used.

Therefore, in row 4, position 0, it must be 8.

So, row 4: 8 2 _ 7 1 3 4 5 _

Now, position 2 in row 4 is in column 2 and box 4.

Column 2: rows 0 to 8.

Given:

Row 0: 9

Row 1: 6

Row 2: 3

Row 3: _

Row 4: _

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: 1

So, in column 2, we have 9,6,3,1.

Therefore, missing numbers: 2,4,5,7,8

But, for row 4, position 2, possible numbers are 6,8,9 (since row 4 missing is 6,8,9), but 6 and 9 are not in column 2, but 8 is possible.

Wait, no: wait, row 4 missing is 6,8,9, but column 2 has 9 and 6, so only 8 is possible.

Wait, but 8 is already in row 4 at position 0.

Wait, no: wait, row 4 has position 0 as 8, position 1 as 2, position 2 is empty, position 3 is 7, position 4 is 1, position 5 is 3, position 6 is 4, position 7 is 5, position 8 is empty.

So, in row 4, position 2 must be 9, because 6 is excluded due to column 2 having 9 already? Wait, no: column 2 has 9 in row 0.

But, in box 4, which is rows 3-5, columns 3-5.

Wait, position 2 in row 4 is column 2, which is in box 1, not box 4.

Wait, no: wait, boxes are:

Box 0: rows 0-2, columns 0-2

Box 1: rows 0-2, columns 3-5

Box 2: rows 0-2, columns 6-8

Box 3: rows 3-5, columns 0-2

Box 4: rows 3-5, columns 3-5

Box 5: rows 3-5, columns 6-8

Box 6: rows 6-8, columns 0-2

Box 7: rows 6-8, columns 3-5

Box 8: rows 6-8, columns 6-8

So, row 4, column 2 is in box 1.

Box 1: rows 3-5, columns 0-2.

Wait, no: wait, boxes are:

Box 0: rows 0-2, columns 0-2

Box 1: rows 0-2, columns 3-5

Box 2: rows 0-2, columns 6-8

Box 3: rows 3-5, columns 0-2

Box 4: rows 3-5, columns 3-5

Box 5: rows 3-5, columns 6-8

Box 6: rows 6-8, columns 0-2

Box 7: rows 6-8, columns 3-5

Box 8: rows 6-8, columns 6-8

Wait, row 4, column 2 is in box 1: rows 0-2, columns 3-5.

Wait, no: wait, perhaps I'm confused.

Wait, in Sudoku, the boxes are divided into rows and columns.

Actually, the 3x3 boxes are formed by taking the first three rows and first three columns for box 0, then columns 3-5 for box 1, etc.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the box indices.

Box 0: rows 0-2, columns 0-2

Box 1: rows 0-2, columns 3-5

Box 2: rows 0-2, columns 6-8

Box 3: rows 3-5, columns 0-2

Box 4: rows 3-5, columns 3-5

Box 5: rows 3-5, columns 6-8

Box 6: rows 6-8, columns 0-2

Box 7: rows 6-8, columns 3-5

Box 8: rows 6-8, columns 6-8

So, row 4, column 2 is in box 1: rows 0-2, columns 3-5.

Wait, no: wait, row 4 is in rows 3-5, and column 2 is in columns 0-2, so it's in box 3.

Wait, let's calculate box index:

Box row = floor(row / 3)

Box column = floor(column / 3)

Box index = box row * 3 + box column

So, for row 4, column 2:

Box row = floor(4 / 3) = 1

Box column = floor(2 / 3) = 0

Box index = 1 * 3 + 0 = 3, which is box 3.

So, row 4, column 2 is in box 3.

Box 3: rows 3-5, columns 0-2.

Given:

Row 3: column 0 is 6, columns 1 and 2 are empty

Row 4: column 0 is 8, column 1 is 2, column 2 is empty

Row 5: columns 0,1,2 are empty

So, in box 3, we have 6,8,2.

Therefore, missing numbers in box 3: 1,3,4,5,7,9

But, for row 4, position 2, possible numbers are 6,8,9 (from earlier), but 8 is already used in row 4, position 0.

So, possible numbers for row 4, position 2: 9

But, 9 is in box 3's missing numbers: 1,3,4,5,7,9

So, row 4, position 2 is 9.

Therefore, row 4: 8 2 9 7 1 3 4 5 _

Now, position 8 in row 4 is in box 5.

Box 5: rows 3-5, columns 6-8.

Given:

Row 3: columns 6-8 are empty

Row 4: column 6 is 4, column 7 is 5, column 8 is empty

Row 5: columns 6-8 are empty

So, in box 5, we have 4 and 5.

Missing numbers: 1,2,3,6,7,8,9

But, for row 4, position 8, possible numbers are 6,8,9 (from earlier), but 9 is already used in row 4, position 2.

So, possible numbers for row 4, position 8: 6,8

But, in box 5, 6,8,9 are possible, but 9 is used in row 4 already, so position 8 can be 6 or 8.

Wait, but in box 5, 6 and 8 are possible.

But in row 4, position 8 can be 6 or 8.

So, row 4: 8 2 9 7 1 3 4 5 6 or 8

But, need to check column 8.

Column 8:

Row 0: _

Row 1: 5

Row 2: 4

Row 3: _

Row 4: 6 or 8

Row 5: 2

Row 6: _

Row 7: 7

Row 8: _

So, in column 8, we have 5,4,2,7.

Missing numbers: 1,3,6,8,9

Therefore, for row 4, position 8, possible numbers are 6 and 8, and both are in the missing list for column 8.

So, row 4 position 8 can be either 6 or 8.

But, since row 4 must have one of these, and box 5 allows both, I need more information to decide.

Maybe I should look at another row.

Let's look at row 7: 9 _ _ 4 _ _ 8 _ 7

Row 7 has positions 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Given: position 0 is 9, position 3 is 4, position 6 is 8, position 8 is 7.

So, missing numbers: 1,2,3,5,6

Positions 1,2,4,5,7 are empty.

Now, let's consider box 6: rows 6-8, columns 0-2.

Row 6: column 0 is 3, columns 1 and 2 are empty

Row 7: column 0 is 9, columns 1 and 2 are empty

Row 8: column 0 is _, column 1 is _, column 2 is 1

So, in box 6, we have 3,9,1.

Missing numbers: 2,4,5,6,7,8

Now, for row 7, positions 1 and 2 are in box 6.

Possible numbers for row 7, positions 1 and 2: intersection of row missing (1,2,3,5,6) and box missing (2,4,5,6,7,8)

Intersection: 2,5,6

So, positions 1 and 2 in row 7 can be 2,5,6.

Similarly, position 4 in row 7 is in box 7: rows 6-8, columns 3-5.

Given:

Row 6: columns 3-5 are empty

Row 7: columns 3-5 are empty, except column 3 is 4

Row 8: columns 3-5 are _,2,5

So, in box 7, we have 4,2,5.

Missing numbers: 1,3,6,7,8,9

For row 7, positions 4,5,7 are in box 7.

Possible numbers for these positions: intersection of row missing (1,2,3,5,6) and box missing (1,3,6,7,8,9)

Intersection: 1,3,6

So, positions 4,5,7 in row 7 can be 1,3,6.

Now, position 7 in row 7 is in box 7.

Possible numbers: 1,3,6

But, in column 7:

Row 0: _

Row 1: _

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: 5

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: _

Wait, row 4 has position 7 as 5, but in row 7, position 7 can be 1,3,6.

So, no conflict there.

Similarly, position 5 in row 7 is in box 7.

Possible numbers: 1,3,6

But, column 5:

Row 0: 8

Row 1: 4

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: 3

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: _

So, in column 5, we have 8,4,3.

Missing numbers: 1,2,5,6,7,9

Therefore, for row 7, position 5: intersection of row missing (1,2,3,5,6), box missing (1,3,6,7,8,9), and column missing (1,2,5,6,7,9): 1,6

So, position 5 in row 7 can be 1 or 6.

Similarly, position 4 in row 7 is in box 7.

Possible numbers: 1,3,6

Column 4:

Row 0: _

Row 1: _

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: 1

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: 5

So, in column 4, we have 1 and 5.

Missing numbers: 2,3,4,6,7,8,9

Therefore, for row 7, position 4: intersection of row missing (1,2,3,5,6), box missing (1,3,6,7,8,9), and column missing (2,3,4,6,7,8,9): 1,3,6

But, position 5 can only be 1 or 6, so position 4 can be 1,3,6, but need to ensure that 1 and 6 are not both used in positions 4 and 5.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that.

If position 5 is 1, then position 4 can be 3 or 6.

If position 5 is 6, then position 4 can be 1 or 3.

Similarly, position 7 would be the remaining number.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look at another row.

Let's look at row 6: 3 _ _ _ _ _ 5 _ _

Row 6 has positions 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Given: position 0 is 3, position 6 is 5.

Missing numbers: 1,2,4,6,7,8,9

Positions 1,2,3,4,5,7,8 are empty.

Now, position 1 in row 6 is in box 2: rows 0-2, columns 6-8.

Wait, no: wait, boxes are:

Box 0: rows 0-2, columns 0-2

Box 1: rows 0-2, columns 3-5

Box 2: rows 0-2, columns 6-8

Box 3: rows 3-5, columns 0-2

Box 4: rows 3-5, columns 3-5

Box 5: rows 3-5, columns 6-8

Box 6: rows 6-8, columns 0-2

Box 7: rows 6-8, columns 3-5

Box 8: rows 6-8, columns 6-8

So, row 6, position 1 is in box 6: rows 6-8, columns 0-2.

Wait, no: position 1 is column 1, which is in box 6: rows 6-8, columns 0-2.

Wait, no: box 6 is rows 6-8, columns 0-2.

So, positions 0,1,2 in rows 6,7,8.

Similarly, position 3 is in box 7: rows 6-8, columns 3-5.

Position 4 is in box 7.

Position 5 is in box 7.

Position 6 is in box 8: rows 6-8, columns 6-8.

Position 7 is in box 8.

Position 8 is in box 8.

Alright, let's consider position 1 in row 6, which is in box 6.

Box 6: rows 6-8, columns 0-2.

Given:

Row 6: position 0 is 3, positions 1 and 2 are empty

Row 7: position 0 is 9, positions 1 and 2 are empty

Row 8: positions 0,1,2 are empty, but position 2 is 1.

Wait, row 8, position 2 is 1.

So, in box 6, we have 3,9,1.

Missing numbers: 2,4,5,6,7,8

Therefore, possible numbers for row 6, position 1: 2,4,5,6,7,8

But, row 6 missing is 1,2,4,6,7,8,9

Intersection: 2,4,6,7,8

Now, looking at column 1:

Row 0: _

Row 1: _

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: 2

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: _

So, in column 1, we have 2.

Missing numbers: 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

Therefore, for row 6, position 1: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,6,7,8,9), box missing (2,4,5,6,7,8), and column missing (1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9): 2,4,6,7,8

But, 2 is already in row 4, position 1, but that doesn't directly affect row 6, position 1.

Wait, no: in column 1, row 4 has 2, so in column 1, 2 is used.

Therefore, in row 6, position 1, 2 cannot be used.

Wait, but row 4 has position 1 as 2, so in column 1, 2 is already used.

Therefore, in row 6, position 1, 2 cannot be used.

So, possible numbers for row 6, position 1: 4,6,7,8

Similarly, position 2 in row 6 is in box 6.

Possible numbers: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,6,7,8,9), box missing (2,4,5,6,7,8), and column 2 missing numbers.

Column 2:

Row 0: 9

Row 1: 6

Row 2: 3

Row 3: _

Row 4: 9

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: 1

So, in column 2, we have 9,6,3,1.

Missing numbers: 2,4,5,7,8

Therefore, for row 6, position 2: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,6,7,8,9), box missing (2,4,5,6,7,8), and column missing (2,4,5,7,8): 2,4,6,7,8

But, 6 is in box 6's missing numbers, but in column 2, 6 is already used in row 1.

Wait, column 2 has 6 in row 1, so in row 6, position 2, 6 cannot be used.

Wait, but box 6 missing has 6, but column 2 has 6 in row 1, so in column 2, 6 is already used.

Therefore, in row 6, position 2, 6 cannot be used.

So, possible numbers for row 6, position 2: 2,4,7,8

Similarly, position 3 in row 6 is in box 7: rows 6-8, columns 3-5.

Given:

Row 6: positions 3-5 are empty

Row 7: positions 3-5 are empty, except position 3 is 4

Row 8: positions 3-5 are _,2,5

So, in box 7, we have 4,2,5.

Missing numbers: 1,3,6,7,8,9

Therefore, possible numbers for row 6, position 3: 1,3,6,7,8,9

But, row 6 missing is 1,2,4,6,7,8,9

Intersection: 1,6,7,8,9

Similarly, column 3:

Row 0: _

Row 1: _

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: 7

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: 4

Row 8: 2

So, in column 3, we have 7,4,2.

Missing numbers: 1,3,5,6,8,9

Therefore, for row 6, position 3: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,6,7,8,9), box missing (1,3,6,7,8,9), and column missing (1,3,5,6,8,9): 1,6,7,8,9

But, position 7 in row 7 has 4, which is in column 3.

Wait, row 7, position 3 is 4, which is in column 3.

Wait, row 7, position 3 is 4, which is in column 3.

So, in column 3, we have 7,4,2.

Therefore, for row 6, position 3: 1,3,5,6,8,9

But, box 7 missing is 1,3,6,7,8,9

Intersection: 1,3,6,8,9

And row 6 missing is 1,2,4,6,7,8,9

Intersection: 1,6,8,9

Wait, seems like I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, column 3 missing is 1,3,5,6,8,9

Box 7 missing is 1,3,6,7,8,9

Row 6 missing is 1,2,4,6,7,8,9

Intersection: 1,6,8,9

So, possible numbers for row 6, position 3: 1,6,8,9

Similarly, position 4 in row 6 is in box 7.

Possible numbers: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,6,7,8,9), box missing (1,3,6,7,8,9), and column 4 missing numbers.

Column 4:

Row 0: _

Row 1: _

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: 1

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: 5

So, in column 4, we have 1 and 5.

Missing numbers: 2,3,4,6,7,8,9

Therefore, for row 6, position 4: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,6,7,8,9), box missing (1,3,6,7,8,9), and column missing (2,3,4,6,7,8,9): 1,6,7,8,9

But, need to consider that position 5 in row 6 is also in box 7.

Position 5 in row 6 is in box 7.

Possible numbers: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,6,7,8,9), box missing (1,3,6,7,8,9), and column 5 missing numbers.

Column 5:

Row 0: 8

Row 1: 4

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: 3

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: _

So, in column 5, we have 8,4,3.

Missing numbers: 1,2,5,6,7,9

Therefore, for row 6, position 5: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,6,7,8,9), box missing (1,3,6,7,8,9), and column missing (1,2,5,6,7,9): 1,6,7,9

Similarly, position 7 in row 6 is in box 8: rows 6-8, columns 6-8.

Given:

Row 6: position 6 is 5, positions 7 and 8 are empty

Row 7: positions 6-8 are empty

Row 8: positions 6-8 are 3, _, 7

So, in box 8, we have 5,3,7.

Missing numbers: 1,2,4,6,8,9

Therefore, possible numbers for row 6, position 7: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,6,7,8,9), box missing (1,2,4,6,8,9), and column 7 missing numbers.

Column 7:

Row 0: _

Row 1: _

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: 5

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: _

So, in column 7, we have 5.

Missing numbers: 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9

Therefore, for row 6, position 7: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,6,7,8,9), box missing (1,2,4,6,8,9), and column missing (1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9): 1,2,4,6,8,9

Similarly, position 8 in row 6 is in box 8.

Possible numbers: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,6,7,8,9), box missing (1,2,4,6,8,9), and column 8 missing numbers.

Column 8:

Row 0: _

Row 1: 5

Row 2: 4

Row 3: _

Row 4: _

Row 5: 2

Row 6: _

Row 7: 7

Row 8: _

So, in column 8, we have 5,4,2,7.

Missing numbers: 1,3,6,8,9

Therefore, for row 6, position 8: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,6,7,8,9), box missing (1,2,4,6,8,9), and column missing (1,3,6,8,9): 1,6,8,9

Now, looking at row 6, positions 1,2,3,4,5,7,8 have possible numbers as follows:

Position 1: 4,6,7,8

Position 2: 2,4,7,8

Position 3: 1,6,8,9

Position 4: 1,6,7,8,9

Position 5: 1,6,7,9

Position 7: 1,2,4,6,8,9

Position 8: 1,6,8,9

This seems too broad. Maybe I need to look for unique possibilities or use some Sudoku techniques like naked singles or hidden singles.

Looking back, perhaps I should try a different approach.

Let me try to list all the given numbers again to see if I can find a better starting point.

Given:

Row 0: column 2 is 9, column 4 is 2, column 5 is 8, column 6 is 7

Row 1: column 0 is 8, column 2 is 6, column 5 is 4, column 8 is 5

Row 2: column 2 is 3, column 8 is 4

Row 3: column 0 is 6

Row 4: column 1 is 2, column 3 is 7, column 4 is 1, column 5 is 3, column 6 is 4, column 7 is 5

Row 5: column 8 is 2

Row 6: column 0 is 3, column 6 is 5

Row 7: column 0 is 9, column 3 is 4, column 6 is 8, column 8 is 7

Row 8: column 2 is 1, column 3 is 2, column 4 is 5, column 6 is 3

Alright, perhaps I can look for cells where only one number can fit.

Let's try row 4 again.

Row 4: 8 2 9 7 1 3 4 5 _

We previously determined that position 8 can be 6 or 8.

But, looking at column 8, we have:

Row 0: _

Row 1: 5

Row 2: 4

Row 3: _

Row 4: 6 or 8

Row 5: 2

Row 6: _

Row 7: 7

Row 8: _

In column 8, we have 5,4,2,7.

So, missing numbers: 1,3,6,8,9

But, in row 4, position 8 can be 6 or 8.

But, in box 5 (rows 3-5, columns 6-8), we have:

Row 3: positions 6-8 are empty

Row 4: position 6 is 4, position 7 is 5, position 8 is 6 or 8

Row 5: positions 6-8 are empty, but position 8 is 2.

Wait, row 5, position 8 is 2.

Wait, row 5, column 8 is 2.

Wait, no: row 5, column 8 is given as 2.

Wait, in row 5, column 8 is 2.

Wait, in row 5, column 8 is 2.

Wait, perhaps I misread earlier.

Given: row 5, column 8 is 2.

So, in column 8, we have row 1:5, row 2:4, row 5:2, row 7:7.

Missing numbers: 1,3,6,8,9

Therefore, for row 4, position 8, possible numbers are 6 and 8.

But, in box 5, which is rows 3-5, columns 6-8.

Given:

Row 3: positions 6-8 are empty

Row 4: position 6 is 4, position 7 is 5, position 8 is 6 or 8

Row 5: positions 6-8 are empty, but position 8 is 2.

Wait, row 5, position 8 is 2.

So, in box 5, we have 4,5,2.

Therefore, missing numbers in box 5: 1,3,6,7,8,9

Therefore, for row 4, position 8, possible numbers are 6 and 8.

But, in column 8, 6 is possible, but 8 is also possible.

So, I need more information.

Maybe I should look at another box or row.

Let's look at row 3: 6 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Row 3 has position 0 is 6, and the rest are empty.

Missing numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9

Now, position 1 in row 3 is in box 3: rows 3-5, columns 0-2.

Box 3: rows 3-5, columns 0-2.

Given:

Row 3: position 0 is 6, positions 1 and 2 are empty

Row 4: positions 0 is 8, position 1 is 2, position 2 is 9

Row 5: positions 0,1,2 are empty

So, in box 3, we have 6,8,2,9

Missing numbers: 1,3,4,5,7

Therefore, possible numbers for row 3, position 1: 1,3,4,5,7

Similarly, position 2 in row 3 is in box 3.

Possible numbers: 1,3,4,5,7

Now, column 1:

Row 0: _

Row 1: _

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: 2

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: _

So, in column 1, we have 2.

Missing numbers: 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

Therefore, for row 3, position 1: intersection of row missing (1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9), box missing (1,3,4,5,7), and column missing (1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9): 1,3,4,5,7

Similarly, position 2 in row 3 is in box 3.

Possible numbers: 1,3,4,5,7

Column 2:

Row 0: 9

Row 1: 6

Row 2: 3

Row 3: _

Row 4: 9

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: 1

So, in column 2, we have 9,6,3,1.

Missing numbers: 2,4,5,7,8

Therefore, for row 3, position 2: intersection of row missing (1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9), box missing (1,3,4,5,7), and column missing (2,4,5,7,8): 1,3,4,5,7

Hmm, not very helpful.

Maybe I should look at position 4 in row 3, which is in box 4: rows 3-5, columns 3-5.

Box 4: rows 3-5, columns 3-5.

Given:

Row 3: positions 3-5 are empty

Row 4: positions 3 is 7, position 4 is 1, position 5 is 3

Row 5: positions 3-5 are empty

So, in box 4, we have 7,1,3.

Missing numbers: 2,4,5,6,8,9

Therefore, possible numbers for row 3, positions 3,4,5: 2,4,5,6,8,9

Similarly, column 3:

Row 0: _

Row 1: _

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: 7

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: 4

Row 8: 2

So, in column 3, we have 7,4,2.

Missing numbers: 1,3,5,6,8,9

Therefore, for row 3, position 3: intersection of row missing (1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9), box missing (2,4,5,6,8,9), and column missing (1,3,5,6,8,9): 2,4,5,6,8,9

Similarly, position 4 in row 3 is in box 4.

Possible numbers: intersection of row missing (1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9), box missing (2,4,5,6,8,9), and column 4 missing numbers.

Column 4:

Row 0: _

Row 1: _

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: 1

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: 5

So, in column 4, we have 1 and 5.

Missing numbers: 2,3,4,6,7,8,9

Therefore, for row 3, position 4: intersection of row missing (1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9), box missing (2,4,5,6,8,9), and column missing (2,3,4,6,7,8,9): 2,4,5,6,8,9

Similarly, position 5 in row 3 is in box 4.

Possible numbers: intersection of row missing (1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9), box missing (2,4,5,6,8,9), and column 5 missing numbers.

Column 5:

Row 0: 8

Row 1: 4

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: 3

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: _

So, in column 5, we have 8,4,3.

Missing numbers: 1,2,5,6,7,9

Therefore, for row 3, position 5: intersection of row missing (1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9), box missing (2,4,5,6,8,9), and column missing (1,2,5,6,7,9): 2,4,5,6,8,9

Hmm, still too broad.

Maybe I should look at another row.

Let's look at row 2: _ _ 3 _ _ _ _ _ 4

Row 2 has positions 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Given: position 2 is 3, position 8 is 4.

Missing numbers: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9

Now, position 0 in row 2 is in box 0: rows 0-2, columns 0-2.

Box 0: rows 0-2, columns 0-2.

Given:

Row 0: positions 0 and 1 are empty, position 2 is 9

Row 1: position 0 is 8, position 1 is empty, position 2 is 6

Row 2: position 0 is empty, position 1 is empty, position 2 is 3

So, in box 0, we have 9,8,6,3.

Missing numbers: 1,2,4,5,7

Therefore, possible numbers for row 2, position 0: 1,2,4,5,7

Similarly, position 1 in row 2 is in box 0.

Possible numbers: 1,2,4,5,7

Now, column 0:

Row 0: _

Row 1: 8

Row 2: _

Row 3: 6

Row 4: _

Row 5: _

Row 6: 3

Row 7: 9

Row 8: _

So, in column 0, we have 8,6,3,9.

Missing numbers: 1,2,4,5,7

Therefore, for row 2, position 0: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9), box missing (1,2,4,5,7), and column missing (1,2,4,5,7): 1,2,4,5,7

Similarly, position 1 in row 2 is in box 0.

Possible numbers: 1,2,4,5,7

Column 1:

Row 0: _

Row 1: _

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: 2

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: _

So, in column 1, we have 2.

Missing numbers: 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

Therefore, for row 2, position 1: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9), box missing (1,2,4,5,7), and column missing (1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9): 1,2,4,5,7

Hmm, still not helpful.

Maybe I should look at position 3 in row 2, which is in box 1: rows 0-2, columns 3-5.

Box 1: rows 0-2, columns 3-5.

Given:

Row 0: positions 3-5 are empty, position 4 is 2, position 5 is 8

Row 1: positions 3-5 are empty, position 5 is 4

Row 2: positions 3-5 are empty

So, in box 1, we have 2,8,4.

Missing numbers: 1,3,5,6,7,9

Therefore, possible numbers for row 2, position 3: 1,3,5,6,7,9

Similarly, column 3:

Row 0: _

Row 1: _

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: 7

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: 4

Row 8: 2

So, in column 3, we have 7,4,2.

Missing numbers: 1,3,5,6,8,9

Therefore, for row 2, position 3: intersection of row missing (1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9), box missing (1,3,5,6,7,9), and column missing (1,3,5,6,8,9): 1,3,5,6,7,9

Still too broad.

Maybe I need to try a different approach.

Let me try to look for a number that can only go in one cell in a row, column, or box.

Let's try number 1.

Looking for where 1 can be placed.

In row 0: possible positions where 1 can be placed.

Row 0 missing numbers: 1,3,4,5,6

So, positions 0,1,3,7,8 are possible for 1.

But, need to check column and box constraints.

Positions in row 0:

Position 0: box 0

Position 1: box 0

Position 3: box 1

Position 7: box 2

Position 8: box 2

Now, in box 0, which contains positions 0 and 1 of row 0, the missing numbers are 1,4,5.

So, position 0 and 1 in row 0 can have 1,4,5.

Similarly, position 3 in row 0 is in box 1, which has missing numbers 1,3,5,6,7,9

So, position 3 in row 0 can have 1,3,5,6

Position 7 in row 0 is in box 2, which has missing numbers 1,2,3,6,8,9

So, position 7 in row 0 can have 1,3,6

Position 8 in row 0 is in box 2, which has missing numbers 1,2,3,6,8,9

So, position 8 in row 0 can have 1,3,6

Therefore, in row 0, positions 0,1,3,7,8 can have 1.

Now, looking at column constraints.

Column for position 0: columns 0

Given in column 0: rows 1 has 8, row 3 has 6, row 6 has 3, row 7 has 9

So, in column 0, numbers used: 8,6,3,9

Therefore, possible numbers in column 0: 1,2,4,5,7

So, for row 0, position 0: intersection of row possible (1,4,5), box possible (1,4,5), and column possible (1,2,4,5,7): 1,4,5

Similarly, position 1 in row 0 is in column 1.

Column 1: rows 4 has 2, rows 7 has _

So, in column 1, number 2 is used.

Missing numbers: 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

Therefore, for row 0, position 1: 1,4,5

Position 3 in row 0 is in column 3.

Column 3: rows 4 has 7, row 7 has 4, row 8 has 2

So, in column 3, numbers used: 7,4,2

Missing numbers: 1,3,5,6,8,9

Therefore, for row 0, position 3: intersection of row possible (1,3,5,6), box possible (1,3,5,6,7,9), column possible (1,3,5,6,8,9): 1,3,5,6

Position 7 in row 0 is in column 7.

Column 7: rows 4 has 5, row 7 has _

Missing numbers: 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9

Therefore, for row 0, position 7: intersection of row possible (1,3,6), box possible (1,2,3,6,8,9), column possible (1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9): 1,3,6

Position 8 in row 0 is in column 8.

Column 8: rows 1 has 5, row 2 has 4, row 5 has 2, row 7 has 7

Numbers used: 5,4,2,7

Missing numbers: 1,3,6,8,9

Therefore, for row 0, position 8: intersection of row possible (1,3,6), box possible (1,2,3,6,8,9), column possible (1,3,6,8,9): 1,3,6

So, in row 0, positions 0,1,3,7,8 can have 1, but I need to see if 1 can only go in one of these positions.

Looking at box 0: positions 0 and 1 in row 0 can have 1,4,5

Also, row 1, positions 0 and 1 in box 0 can have certain numbers.

Wait, row 1, positions 0,1,3 in box 0.

Row 1: position 0 is 8, position 1 is _, position 2 is 6, position 3 is _, position 4 is _, position 5 is 4, position 6 is _, position 7 is _, position 8 is 5

So, in box 0: row 1, positions 0 is 8, position 1 is _, position 2 is 6

Row 2: positions 0,1,2 are _, _, 3

So, in box 0, missing numbers are 1,2,4,5,7

Therefore, in box 0, only row 0 positions 0 and 1 can have 1.

Row 1, position 1 can have 1,2,4,5,7

Row 2, positions 0 and 1 can have 1,2,4,5,7

So, in box 0, positions row 0 pos 0, row 0 pos 1, row 1 pos 1, row 2 pos 0, row 2 pos 1 can have 1.

But, in row 0, positions 0 and 1 can have 1,4,5

In row 1, position 1 can have 1,2,4,5,7

In row 2, positions 0 and 1 can have 1,2,4,5,7

So, 1 can be in any of these positions in box 0.

Similarly, in row 0, positions 3,7,8 can have 1.

But, position 3 is in box 1, positions 7 and 8 are in box 2.

In box 1, which is rows 0-2, columns 3-5.

Positions in box 1:

Row 0: positions 3,4,5

Row 1: positions 3,4,5

Row 2: positions 3,4,5

Given:

Row 0: position 4 is 2, position 5 is 8

Row 1: position 5 is 4

Row 2: positions 3-5 are empty

So, in box 1, missing numbers are 1,3,5,6,7,9

Therefore, position 3 in row 0 can have 1,3,5,6

Similarly, in box 2, which is rows 0-2, columns 6-8.

Positions in box 2:

Row 0: positions 6,7,8

Row 1: positions 6,7,8

Row 2: positions 6,7,8

Given:

Row 0: position 6 is 7, position 7 is _, position 8 is _

Row 1: position 6 is _, position 7 is _, position 8 is 5

Row 2: positions 6,7,8 are empty

So, in box 2, missing numbers are 1,2,3,6,8,9

Therefore, position 7 in row 0 can have 1,3,6

Position 8 in row 0 can have 1,3,6

So, in row 0, positions 0,1,3,7,8 can have 1.

But, in box 0, positions row 0 pos 0 and 1, row 1 pos 1, row 2 pos 0 and 1 can have 1.

In box 1, positions row 0 pos 3, row 1 pos 3 and 4, row 2 pos 3,4,5 can have 1.

In box 2, positions row 0 pos 7 and 8, row 1 pos 6,7,8, row 2 pos 6,7,8 can have 1.

So, 1 can be in multiple positions across boxes and rows.

This seems too broad. Maybe I should look for a number that can only go in one cell in a particular row, column, or box.

Let me try number 9.

Looking for where 9 can be placed.

Given that row 0 has position 2 as 9, row 1 has position 2 as 6, row 2 has position 2 as 3, row 3 has position 0 as 6, row 4 has position 2 as 9, row 5 has position 8 as 2, row 6 has position 0 as 3, position 6 as 5, row 7 has position 0 as 9, position 6 as 8, position 8 as 7, row 8 has position 2 as 1, position 3 as 2, position 4 as 5, position 6 as 3.

Wait, row 4 has position 2 as 9?

Wait, row 4: _ 2 _ 7 1 3 4 5 _

So, position 2 is 9.

Yes.

So, row 0, position 2 is 9

Row 1, position 2 is 6

Row 2, position 2 is 3

Row 3: position 0 is 6

Row 4: position 2 is 9

Row 5: position 8 is 2

Row 6: position 0 is 3, position 6 is 5

Row 7: position 0 is 9, position 6 is 8, position 8 is 7

Row 8: position 2 is 1, position 3 is 2, position 4 is 5, position 6 is 3

So, 9 is in row 0 position 2, row 4 position 2, row 7 position 0.

So, in box 0: row 0 pos 2 is 9, row 1 pos 2 is 6, row 2 pos 2 is 3

So, in box 0, 9 is in row 0 pos 2.

In box 1: rows 0-2, columns 3-5.

Row 0: pos 3-5 are _,2,8

Row 1: pos 3-5 are _,_,4

Row 2: pos 3-5 are _,_._

So, in box 1, no 9 is present.

Similarly, box 2: rows 0-2, columns 6-8.

Row 0: pos 6-8 are 7,_._

Row 1: pos 6-8 are _,_,5

Row 2: pos 6-8 are _._._

So, in box 2, no 9 is present.

Box 3: rows 3-5, columns 0-2.

Row 3: pos 0 is 6, pos 1 and 2 are empty

Row 4: pos 0 is 8, pos 1 is 2, pos 2 is 9

Row 5: pos 0,1,2 are empty

So, in box 3, row 4 pos 2 is 9.

Box 4: rows 3-5, columns 3-5.

Row 3: pos 3-5 are empty

Row 4: pos 3 is 7, pos 4 is 1, pos 5 is 3

Row 5: pos 3-5 are empty

So, in box 4, no 9 is present.

Box 5: rows 3-5, columns 6-8.

Row 3: pos 6-8 are empty

Row 4: pos 6 is 4, pos 7 is 5, pos 8 is _

Row 5: pos 6-8 are empty

So, in box 5, no 9 is present.

Box 6: rows 6-8, columns 0-2.

Row 6: pos 0 is 3, pos 1 and 2 are empty

Row 7: pos 0 is 9, pos 1 and 2 are empty

Row 8: pos 0 is _, pos 1 is _, pos 2 is 1

So, in box 6, row 7 pos 0 is 9.

Box 7: rows 6-8, columns 3-5.

Row 6: pos 3-5 are empty

Row 7: pos 3 is 4, pos 4 and 5 are empty

Row 8: pos 3 is 2, pos 4 is 5, pos 5 is _

So, in box 7, no 9 is present.

Box 8: rows 6-8, columns 6-8.

Row 6: pos 6 is 5, pos 7 and 8 are empty

Row 7: pos 6 is 8, pos 7 is _, pos 8 is 7

Row 8: pos 6 is 3, pos 7 is _, pos 8 is _

So, in box 8, no 9 is present.

Therefore, 9 is only in boxes 0,3,6.

Now, looking at rows:

Row 0 has 9 in position 2

Row 4 has 9 in position 2

Row 7 has 9 in position 0

So, rows 1,2,3,5,6,8 do not have 9.

Similarly, columns:

Column 0: row 7 has 9

Column 2: row 0 has 9

Column 6: no 9

Wait, row 7 has position 0 is 9, which is column 0.

Column 2: row 0 has 9.

So, columns 1,3,4,5,7,8 do not have 9.

Now, looking for where 9 can be placed in rows without 9.

Row 1: no 9

Row 2: no 9

Row 3: no 9

Row 5: no 9

Row 6: no 9

Row 8: no 9

But, boxes already have 9 in boxes 0,3,6.

So, boxes 1,2,4,5,7,8 can have 9.

But, row 1 is in boxes 0 and 1.

Row 2 is in boxes 0,1,2.

Row 3 is in boxes 3,4,5.

Row 5 is in boxes 4,5,8.

Row 6 is in boxes 6,7,8.

Row 8 is in boxes 6,7,8.

So, in box 1: rows 0,1,2; columns 3-5.

Possible positions for 9: row 0 pos 3,4,5; row 1 pos 3,4,5; row 2 pos 3,4,5

But, in row 0, pos 3 is in box 1.

In row 1, pos 3,4,5 are in box 1.

In row 2, pos 3,4,5 are in box 1.

But, in box 1, missing numbers are 1,3,5,6,7,9

Therefore, 9 can be placed in any of the empty cells in box 1, provided they don't violate row and column constraints.

Similarly, in box 2: rows 0,1,2; columns 6-8.

Possible positions for 9: row 0 pos 6,7,8; row 1 pos 6,7,8; row 2 pos 6,7,8

But, row 0 pos 6 is 7, pos 7 and 8 are empty.

Row 1 pos 6,7,8 are empty.

Row 2 pos 6,7,8 are empty.

So, in box 2, 9 can be placed in row 1 pos 6,7,8 or row 2 pos 6,7,8.

But, need to check column constraints.

Column 6: row 0 pos 6 is 7, row 1 pos 6 is empty, row 2 pos 6 is empty, row 3 pos 6 is empty, row 4 pos 6 is 4, row 5 pos 6 is empty, row 6 pos 6 is 5, row 7 pos 6 is 8, row 8 pos 6 is 3

So, in column 6, numbers used: 7,4,5,8,3

Missing numbers: 1,2,6,9

Therefore, in column 6, 9 can be placed in row 1 pos 6 or row 2 pos 6

Similarly, column 7: row 0 pos 7 is empty, row 1 pos 7 is empty, row 2 pos 7 is empty, row 3 pos 7 is empty, row 4 pos 7 is 5, row 5 pos 7 is empty, row 6 pos 7 is empty, row 7 pos 7 is empty, row 8 pos 7 is empty

So, in column 7, numbers used: 5

Missing numbers: 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9

Therefore, in column 7, 9 can be placed in row 1 pos 7, row 2 pos 7, row 3 pos 7, row 5 pos 7, row 6 pos 7, row 8 pos 7

Similarly, column 8: row 0 pos 8 is empty, row 1 pos 8 is 5, row 2 pos 8 is 4, row 3 pos 8 is empty, row 4 pos 8 is empty, row 5 pos 8 is 2, row 6 pos 8 is empty, row 7 pos 8 is 7, row 8 pos 8 is empty

So, in column 8, numbers used: 5,4,2,7

Missing numbers: 1,3,6,8,9

Therefore, in column 8, 9 can be placed in row 0 pos 8, row 3 pos 8, row 4 pos 8, row 6 pos 8, row 8 pos 8

Now, in box 2, possible positions for 9 are row 1 pos 6,7,8 and row 2 pos 6,7,8, provided they don't violate column constraints.

But, in box 2, missing numbers are 1,2,3,6,8,9

So, possible positions for 9 in box 2 are row 1 pos 6,7,8 and row 2 pos 6,7,8

Now, looking at row 1: positions 0 is 8, pos 2 is 6, pos 5 is 4, pos 8 is 5

So, row 1 missing numbers: 1,2,3,7,9

In box 1: row 1 pos 3,4,5 can have 1,3,5
