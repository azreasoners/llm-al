The generated Python program solves the Tower of Hanoi problem for 3 disks and 3 pegs. Here is the sequence of moves needed to stack all disks on peg c:

Move the top disk from peg a to peg c.
Move the next disk from peg a to peg b.
Move the disk from peg c to peg b.
Move the bottom disk from peg a to peg c.
Move the disk from peg b to peg a.
Move the disk from peg b to peg c.
Move the disk from peg a to peg c.
This sequence effectively transfers all disks to peg c with the largest on the bottom and the smallest on top, adhering to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi. â€‹
