Here's a breakdown of the problem followed by the solution steps. This solution focuses on the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

Understanding the Problem

Objective: Move a stack of three disks (d1, d2, d3) from peg 'a' to peg 'c', following specific rules.
Components:
Locations: Disks, Pegs
Disks: d1, d2, d3. Disks are ordered by size/weight (d1 is the largest, d3 the smallest)
Pegs: a, b, c
Rules:
Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
The Tower of Hanoi

This problem perfectly describes the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle.  There's an optimal solution strategy that can be solved recursively.

Solution Steps

Move the top two disks (d2 and d3) from 'a' to 'b':

Move d2 from 'a' to 'c'
Move d3 from 'a' to 'b'
Move d2 from 'c' to 'b'
Move the largest disk (d1) from 'a' to 'c'.

Move the two disks (d2 and d3) from 'b' to 'c':

Move d2 from 'b' to 'a'
Move d3 from 'b' to 'c'
Move d2 from 'a' to 'c'
Explanation:

The key insight is in the recursive nature of the problem. To move a stack of 'n' disks, you essentially:

Move the top 'n-1' disks to the auxiliary peg (in this case, peg 'b').
Move the largest remaining disk to the goal peg (here, peg 'c').
Move the 'n-1' disks from the auxiliary peg back to the goal peg.
