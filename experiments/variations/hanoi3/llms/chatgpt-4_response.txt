To solve this problem, we can utilize a classical approach based on the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here, we have three disks of different sizes (d1, d2, d3) and three pegs (a, b, c). The objective is to move all disks from peg a to peg c, following the rules that only one disk can be moved at a time and a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

The initial configuration is:

Disk d3 on top of d2
Disk d2 on top of d1
Disk d1 on peg a
Pegs b and c are empty
We want all disks to end up on peg c in the same order, with d3 at the top and d1 at the bottom.

Here is a step-by-step solution:

Move Disk d3 from a to b:
Path: a → b
Configuration: d1 on a, d2 on a, d3 on b
Move Disk d2 from a to c:
Path: a → c
Configuration: d1 on a, d2 on c, d3 on b
Move Disk d3 from b to c:
Path: b → c (on top of d2)
Configuration: d1 on a, d2 on c, d3 on c
Move Disk d1 from a to b:
Path: a → b
Configuration: d1 on b, d2 on c, d3 on c
Move Disk d3 from c to a:
Path: c → a
Configuration: d1 on b, d2 on c, d3 on a
Move Disk d2 from c to b:
Path: c → b (on top of d1)
Configuration: d1 on b, d2 on b, d3 on a
Move Disk d3 from a to b:
Path: a → b (on top of d2)
Configuration: d1 on b, d2 on b, d3 on b
Move Disk d1 from b to c:
Path: b → c
Configuration: d1 on c, d2 on b, d3 on b
Move Disk d3 from b to c:
Path: b → c (on top of d1)
Configuration: d1 on c, d2 on b, d3 on c
Move Disk d2 from b to c:
Path: b → c (on top of d1)
Configuration: d1 on c, d2 on c, d3 on c
This sequence will move all disks from peg a to peg c while adhering to the rules of the puzzle. Each step ensures that a smaller disk is never beneath a larger one, and no disk is moved if another disk is on top of it.
