Thought about disk stacking plan for 4 seconds
Mapping the sequence

I’m laying out the steps to move three disks from peg a to peg c, adhering to the rules of no disc movement if it’s obstructed or heavier. The optimal solution typically spans seven steps.

Piecing together the plan

OK, let me see. I’m listing the steps to move each disk from peg a to peg c, ensuring the largest disk is moved first and all intermediate steps are covered.

Below is one valid 7-step plan (the classic Tower of Hanoi procedure) to move all three disks from peg a to peg c under the given constraints:

Move d1 from peg a to peg c.

(Now d1 is on peg c, d2 is on peg a, d3 is on peg a)
Move d2 from peg a to peg b.

(Now d2 is on peg b, d3 is on peg a, d1 is on peg c)
Move d1 from peg c to peg b (onto d2).

(Now d1 is on top of d2 on peg b, and d3 remains on peg a)
Move d3 from peg a to peg c.

(Now d3 is on peg c, with pegs b and c occupied by smaller disks d1, d2)
Move d1 from peg b to peg a.

(Clears the top of d2 so that d2 can move)
Move d2 from peg b to peg c (onto d3).

(Now d2 is on top of d3 on peg c)
Move d1 from peg a to peg c (onto d2).

(Now the final stack on peg c is d3 at bottom, d2 in the middle, d1 on top)
All disks are now stacked on peg c in the correct order (d3, d2, d1).
