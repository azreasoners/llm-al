Okay, this is a classic Tower of Hanoi problem — we need to move disks from peg A to peg C with constraints. The disks are ordered by weight: d1 is the heaviest, then d2, then d3. We can only move a disk if it's not blocked by another and can't place a heavier disk on a lighter one. So, only smaller disks can go on larger ones. The task is simply to move the stack from peg A to peg C, following these rules.

I’m informed about the classic Tower of Hanoi problem with three disks, where the disks are stacked in this initial order on peg A: d1 (largest) at the bottom, followed by d2, then d3 on top.

Using the classic solution, this would involve 7 moves:

Move d3 from A to C.

Move d2 from A to B.

Move d3 from C to B.

Move d1 from A to C.

Move d3 from B to A.

Move d2 from B to C.

Move d3 from A to C.

This way, all disks will end up in the correct order on peg C.

Below is one valid seven-move solution. The moves are written as “move [disk] from [source] to [target]”:

Move d3 from peg a to peg c.
(d3 is the smallest and topmost disk, so it can move freely.)

Move d2 from peg a to peg b.
(Now d2 is free to move since d3 is no longer on top.)

Move d3 from peg c to peg b.
(Place d3 on top of d2; allowed because d2 is heavier than d3.)

Move d1 from peg a to peg c.
(d1, the heaviest, moves to peg c. It can’t be placed on d2, so we move it to an empty peg.)

Move d3 from peg b to peg a.
(This clears d2 so that it can later be moved on top of d1.)

Move d2 from peg b to peg c.
(Now d2 is moved to peg c and placed on d1, which is allowed since d1 is heavier.)

Move d3 from peg a to peg c.
(Finally, d3 is moved to peg c and placed on d2, completing the stack in order.)

This sequence obeys the rules: a disk is only moved when it has no disk on top, and a disk is only placed on another if the disk underneath is heavier.
