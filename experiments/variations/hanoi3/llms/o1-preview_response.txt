Analyzing the puzzle

First, I’m pinpointing the Tower of Hanoi rules, which include the restriction on moving a larger disk onto a smaller one. This leads me to assume disk d1 is the heaviest, d2 is medium, and d3 is lightest.

Organizing disks

I'm noting the weight hierarchy of disks and their initial peg arrangement. The goal is to relocate all disks to peg c, adhering to the rule of not placing a heavier disk on a lighter one.

Charting the course

OK, let me see. Recalling the Tower of Hanoi method, I start by moving the smallest disk, then the next, and finally the largest, keeping the steps orderly and balanced.

Rearranging disks

OK, let me see. The initial disk configuration seems reversed: d1 is lightest, d3 heaviest. So, disk order is from heaviest to lightest, stacked from bottom to top.

Revisiting disk configuration

I'm rethinking the initial disk setup on peg a. It seems logical for the heaviest disk, d3, to be placed at the bottom, followed by the medium weight disk, d2, and then the lightest disk, d1.

Analyzing disk arrangement

I’m visualizing the stack of disks from the problem, which shows that d1 is at the bottom, d2 is in the middle, and d3 is at the top, with d1 being the heaviest and d3 the lightest.

Assessing disk weights

Starting with the assumption that the disks have different weights, I explore the configuration where disk d3 is the lightest and disk d1 is the heaviest, leading to the standard Tower of Hanoi setup.

Mapping the moves

I’m thinking through the standard Tower of Hanoi solution for three disks, starting with the smallest disk moved to peg c. The goal is to transfer all disks to peg c, adhering to the traditional rules.

Repositioning pieces

I’m lifting d2 from peg a to peg b, then moving d3 from peg c to peg b. Checking if d3 can go on d2, which it can.

To solve this problem, we'll apply a systematic approach similar to the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here’s a step-by-step plan to move all disks from peg a to peg c, following the given rules:

Initial Configuration:

Peg a: Disk d1 (heaviest, bottom), Disk d2, Disk d3 (lightest, top)
Peg b: Empty
Peg c: Empty
Rules:

You can only move the topmost disk from any stack.
A disk cannot be moved onto another disk if it is heavier than the disk it's being placed upon.
Plan:

Move Disk d3 from Peg a to Peg c

Explanation: Disk d3 is the topmost disk on Peg a. Since Peg c is empty, we can place d3 there.
State:
Peg a: d1, d2
Peg b: Empty
Peg c: d3
Move Disk d2 from Peg a to Peg b

Explanation: Now, d2 is the topmost disk on Peg a. Peg b is empty, so we can move d2 there.
State:
Peg a: d1
Peg b: d2
Peg c: d3
Move Disk d3 from Peg c to Peg b

Explanation: Disk d3 can be placed on top of d2 on Peg b because d3 is lighter than d2.
State:
Peg a: d1
Peg b: d2, d3
Peg c: Empty
Move Disk d1 from Peg a to Peg c

Explanation: d1 is the heaviest disk and can be moved to Peg c.
State:
Peg a: Empty
Peg b: d2, d3
Peg c: d1
Move Disk d3 from Peg b to Peg a

Explanation: d3 is the topmost disk on Peg b. We move it back to Peg a.
State:
Peg a: d3
Peg b: d2
Peg c: d1
Move Disk d2 from Peg b to Peg c

Explanation: d2 can be placed on top of d1 on Peg c because d2 is lighter than d1.
State:
Peg a: d3
Peg b: Empty
Peg c: d1, d2
Move Disk d3 from Peg a to Peg c

Explanation: Finally, move d3 onto d2 on Peg c. Since d3 is lighter than d2, this is allowed.
Final State:
Peg a: Empty
Peg b: Empty
Peg c: d1, d2, d3
Summary of Moves:

d3: Peg a ? Peg c
d2: Peg a ? Peg b
d3: Peg c ? Peg b
d1: Peg a ? Peg c
d3: Peg b ? Peg a
d2: Peg b ? Peg c
d3: Peg a ? Peg c
By following this plan, all disks will be successfully stacked on Peg c in the correct order, adhering to the rules of the problem.

Final Answer:

Move d3 from peg a to peg c.
Move d2 from peg a to peg b.
Move d3 from peg c to peg b.
Move d1 from peg a to peg c.
Move d3 from peg b to peg a.
Move d2 from peg b to peg c.
Move d3 from peg a to peg c.
