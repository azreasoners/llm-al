Here's how you can solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 7 disks, along with an explanation of the strategy:

Understanding the Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle.  The rules are:

One disk at a time: You can only move one disk at a time.
Larger on smaller: You cannot place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Three pegs: You have three pegs (A, B, and C) to help you move the disks.
Goal:  Move the entire stack of disks from peg A to peg C, following the rules.

Recursive Solution Strategy

The Tower of Hanoi is solved most easily using a recursive approach. Here's the general idea:

Move the top n-1 disks: To move the largest disk (disk n), you first need to move the stack of n-1 smaller disks on top of it to another peg (peg B).
Move the largest disk: Now you can move the largest disk (disk n) to the target peg (peg C).
Move the n-1 disks back: Finally, move the stack of n-1 disks from the temporary peg (peg B) back onto the largest disk on the target peg (peg C).
7-Disk Solution

Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the puzzle with 7 disks:

Move the top 6 disks from A to B (using C as the temporary peg).
Move disk d7 from A to C.
Move the 6 disks from B to C (using A as the temporary peg).
Detailed Moves (Let's assume the disks are numbered 1 to 7, with 1 being thesmallest):

Move 1 from A to C
Move 2 from A to B
Move 1 from C to B
Move 3 from A to C
... (Continue these steps to move disks 1 through 6 from A to B)
Move 7 from A to C
... (Continue the steps to move disks 1 through 6 from B to C)
Important Notes

Number of moves: The solution for n disks requires 2^n - 1 moves. So for 7 disks, you need 127 moves.
Visualization: There are many online visual simulators for the Tower of Hanoi if you'd like to see it animated.
Let me know if you would like to see the solution for a smaller number of disks, which might be easier to follow initially.
