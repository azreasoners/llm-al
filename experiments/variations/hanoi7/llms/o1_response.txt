Thought about disk stacking plan for 10 seconds
Identifying the problem

I’m analyzing the differences between the number of disks mentioned in the problem statement and the tasks. There’s a contradiction, and the problem states having 5 disks and 3 pegs but then refers to 7 disks.

Addressing the contradiction

I’ve corrected the problem to include 7 disks, labeled from heaviest to lightest (d1 to d7), to align with the puzzle’s requirements.

Revisiting the configuration

I’m considering the Tower of Hanoi setup with 7 disks initially on peg a, aiming to move them to peg c, following the puzzle's standard sequence and requiring 127 moves.

Detailing the steps

I’m outlining the classic Tower of Hanoi method, moving 7 disks from peg A to peg C using peg B as a spare, resulting in a total of 127 moves.

Revisiting the structure

I’m figuring out how to structure the moves: first, transfer the top 6 disks from peg A to peg B using peg C, then move the largest disk (d1) from peg A to peg C, and lastly, shift the 6 disks from peg B to peg C using peg A as auxiliary, totaling 127 moves.

Creating the algorithm

I’m working on a recursive function for the Tower of Hanoi with 7 disks, detailing steps to achieve the minimal 127 moves, using auxiliary pegs as necessary for efficiency.

First, note that this is essentially the classic Tower of Hanoi problem, but with seven disks

  is the lightest (top). All seven disks begin stacked on peg 
𝑎
a, and we want to move the entire tower onto peg 
𝑐
c, using peg 
𝑏
b as an auxiliary.

Key Rules
One disk at a time: You can only move the topmost disk from any stack.
No heavier-on-lighter: You cannot place a heavier disk on top of a lighter disk.
Because all 7 disks start on peg 
𝑎
a (with

High-Level Recursive Strategy

Move the largest (heaviest) disk

Move the 6 disks from peg

Formally, if we label the disks from the top as

​
  the smallest/lightest and

  the largest/heaviest), the classic recursive procedure can be written as:

Edit
Procedure Hanoi(n, from, to, aux):
    if n == 1:
        move disk 1 (smallest of the subset) from "from" to "to"
    else:
        Hanoi(n-1, from, aux, to)
        move disk n (the largest of the subset) from "from" to "to"
        Hanoi(n-1, aux, to, from)
Where:

n is the number of disks to move,
from is the starting peg,
to is the target peg,
aux is the auxiliary peg.
Concrete Plan (Move List)
Below is the outline of the plan. (Expanding it into a full list of 127 moves is possible but quite long; the recursive pattern is what’s typically presented.)

Move 6 Disks from 
𝑎
a to 
𝑏
b using 
𝑐
c as auxiliary.
This itself is done by recursively moving 5 disks from 
𝑎
a to 
𝑐
c, then moving disk 
𝑑
6
d 
6
​
 , then moving the 5 disks from 
𝑐
c to 
𝑏
b, and so on.
Move Disk

  (the heaviest) from 
𝑎
a to 
𝑐
c.
Move 6 Disks from

b to 
𝑐
c using 
𝑎
a as auxiliary.
Again, a recursive procedure of moving 5 disks, then moving disk 
𝑑
6
d 
6
​
 , then moving 5 disks, etc.
In short form, the plan is:

# Step 1: Move d7, d6, d5, d4, d3, d2 (top 6) from a → b
Hanoi(6, a, b, c)

# Step 2: Move the heaviest disk d1 from a → c
move d1 from a to c

# Step 3: Move the 6 disks from b → c
Hanoi(6, b, c, a)
Each Hanoi(6, ...) call above expands to

63+1+63=127 total moves.

Summary
Minimal Moves: 127.
Method: The standard Tower of Hanoi recursion, where you first move the top 6 disks off the largest disk, move the largest disk, and then move the 6 disks again onto the target peg.
Hence, the plan to stack all seven disks
