Okay, we're looking at a problem involving seven disks and three pegs. The disks are stacked in order of size on peg, with d1 on the bottom and d7 on top. The goal seems to be to stack these disks in an ordered way, but there are some rules: you can't move a disk if there's another on top of it, and you can't place a heavier disk on a lighter one. The task is defined, but moving the disks will need careful planning.

Okay, let's figure this out. We have seven disks (d1 through d7), not five like initially stated—looks like a typo. The problem is essentially a Tower of Hanoi puzzle but with a twist, as d1 is the heaviest and can't be placed on any other disk. In a typical Tower of Hanoi, the smallest disk is d1. It’s a bit tricky since the rules say d1 can’t go on top of lighter disks. We still need to find a plan to stack all disks on peg c.

This problem is essentially a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Although the disk numbering here is “reversed” from the usual convention—with d1 being the heaviest and d7 the lightest—the rules remain the same: you can only move one disk at a time, you can’t move a disk that has another on top of it, and you cannot place a heavier disk on top of a lighter one.

Initial Configuration:

Peg a: d1 (heaviest, at the bottom), then d2, then d3, then d4, then d5, then d6, and finally d7 (lightest, at the top)
Pegs b and c: empty
Goal:
Move the entire stack so that all disks are on peg c in the same order (d1 at the bottom and d7 at the top).

The Recursive Strategy
The optimal solution for Tower of Hanoi problems with 
𝑛
n disks takes 
2
𝑛
−
1

 −1 moves. Here, with 7 disks, you’ll need

127

 −1=127 moves.

The strategy is as follows:

Move the top 6 disks from peg a to peg b

This is done recursively.
Think of the 6-disk stack (d2 through d7) as a single unit.
Use peg c as an auxiliary location.
Move the largest disk (d1) from peg a to peg c

d1 is now free to be moved because no disk is on top of it.
Move the 6 disks from peg b to peg c

Again, apply the recursive strategy.
Use peg a as the auxiliary location this time.
Detailed Outline of the Recursive Process
Let’s denote a move by “Move [disk] from [source] to [destination].”

For a stack of n disks (here n = 7), the procedure is:

If n = 1:
Simply move the disk from the source to the destination.

If n > 1:

Move n–1 disks from the source peg (a) to the auxiliary peg (b) using the destination peg (c) as a temporary holding area.
Move the nth (largest) disk from the source peg (a) to the destination peg (c).
Move the n–1 disks from the auxiliary peg (b) to the destination peg (c) using the source peg (a) as temporary storage.
Applying This to Our Problem:

Phase 1:
Move disks d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, and d7 from peg a to peg b (using peg c as auxiliary).

Phase 2:
Move disk d1 from peg a to peg c.

Phase 3:
Move disks d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, and d7 from peg b to peg c (using peg a as auxiliary).

Example of the First Few Moves
To give a taste of the process, here’s how you might begin moving the top 6 disks (remember that the top disk on peg a is d7):

Move d7 from a to c.
Move d6 from a to b.
Move d7 from c to b.
This sequence starts building the stack on peg b. The process continues recursively until all 6 disks are relocated. Then, after moving d1, the reverse process reassembles the 6-disk stack onto peg c.

Final Plan Summary
Total Moves: 127 moves
Plan:
Recursively move the top 6 disks from peg a to peg b (using peg c as the helper).
Move disk d1 (the heaviest) from peg a to peg c.
Recursively move the 6 disks from peg b to peg c (using peg a as the helper).
This recursive strategy guarantees that you never place a heavier disk on a lighter one, and each move is legal under the given rules.

This is your plan to stack all the disks on peg c.
