So I've got this problem here, it's about moving disks from one peg to another, specifically stacking them in a certain order on peg C. Let's see, there are seven disks: d1 through d7, and three pegs: a, b, and c. The disks are stacked on peg a right now, with d1 at the bottom and d7 at the top, and they're ordered from heaviest to lightest, meaning d1 is the heaviest and d7 is the lightest.

The rules are that I can't place a heavier disk on top of a lighter one, and I can't move a disk if there's another disk on top of it. Okay, that sounds a lot like the Tower of Hanoi problem, which I'm familiar with, but usually, the Tower of Hanoi has a specific number of disks, and the general solution is known. However, in this case, there are seven disks, which might take a while to solve manually, but I think I can figure out a plan.

First, I need to understand the initial state:

- Peg a: d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7 (from bottom to top)

- Peg b: empty

- Peg c: empty

And the goal is to have all disks on peg c in the same order: d1 at the bottom, up to d7 at the top.

Since I can't move a disk if there's another disk on top of it, I need to move the topmost disk first. So, starting with d7, which is the lightest, I can move it to peg b or peg c. Maybe I should move it to peg b temporarily, so that I can use peg c for the final stack.

Wait, in the classic Tower of Hanoi, the approach is to move the top n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg, move the largest disk to the target peg, and then move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the target. Maybe I can apply the same strategy here.

So, let's think recursively. To move 7 disks from peg a to peg c, I can:

1. Move the top 6 disks (d2 to d7) from peg a to peg b, using peg c as auxiliary.

2. Move d1 from peg a to peg c.

3. Move the 6 disks from peg b to peg c, placing them on d1.

But wait, d1 is the heaviest, so it can hold any disk on top of it, as long as the disks above are lighter, which they are, since d2 to d7 are lighter than d1.

But actually, looking at the problem again, it says d1 is the heaviest, and d7 is the lightest, and the disks are already stacked in order from heaviest to lightest on peg a. So, the initial stack is stable, with each disk being lighter than the one below it.

In the Tower of Hanoi, the minimum number of moves required to move n disks is 2^n - 1. So for 7 disks, it would be 2^7 - 1 = 127 moves. That's a lot, but I need to find a plan, not necessarily list all 127 moves.

Maybe I can break it down into smaller steps. Let's consider moving the top 6 disks (d2 to d7) to peg b, using peg c as auxiliary. Then, move d1 to peg c, and finally move the 6 disks from peg b on top of d1 on peg c.

Wait, but in the Tower of Hanoi, the auxiliary peg is used to temporarily hold disks while moving them from source to target. So, in this case, to move 6 disks from peg a to peg b, using peg c as auxiliary, I would follow the same recursive pattern.

But to make it simpler, maybe I can consider moving one disk at a time, following the rules, and keep track of the positions.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move d7 from peg a to peg c.

2. Move d6 from peg a to peg b.

3. Move d7 from peg c to peg b, on top of d6.

4. Move d5 from peg a to peg c.

5. Move d7 from peg b to peg a.

6. Move d6 from peg b to peg c.

7. Move d7 from peg a to peg c, on top of d6.

Now, d5, d6, and d7 are on peg c, with d5 at the bottom.

Wait, but I think I'm getting confused here. This seems too simplistic, and I'm not sure if it's the most efficient way.

Maybe I should look up the general solution for the Tower of Hanoi and see how it applies here.

Okay, in the standard Tower of Hanoi, to move n disks from source to target, using auxiliary, the steps are:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, using target as auxiliary.

2. Move the nth disk from source to target.

3. Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to target, using source as auxiliary.

So, applying this to my problem:

- Source: peg a

- Target: peg c

- Auxiliary: peg b

So, to move 7 disks from a to c:

1. Move 6 disks from a to b, using c as auxiliary.

2. Move d1 from a to c.

3. Move 6 disks from b to c, using a as auxiliary.

But moving 6 disks is still a big task. Maybe I can consider moving 3 disks at a time or something to make it more manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a sequence that can be followed without going through the entire recursion.

Let me think about the binary representation or the gray code sequence, which are sometimes used in solving the Tower of Hanoi.

But that might be too complicated for now. Maybe I can look for a general algorithm or formula for the Tower of Hanoi with 7 disks.

Wait, but the problem specifically mentions that a disk cannot be moved if there's another disk on top of it, which is already accounted for in the standard Tower of Hanoi rules.

Also, it says that a disk cannot be moved onto another if it is heavier than it, which is also a standard constraint in Tower of Hanoi.

So, I think the standard solution applies here.

Given that, I can trust that following the recursive steps will lead me to the solution.

But writing out 127 steps is tedious, so maybe I can find a way to generalize the plan.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a sequence of moves that allows me to move the disks in batches.

Wait, another thought: since all disks are ordered from heaviest to lightest on peg a, and I need them in the same order on peg c, perhaps I can move them one by one, ensuring that at each step, I'm not violating the rules.

But that's essentially what the recursive solution does.

Maybe I can try to write down the first few moves and see if a pattern emerges.

So, starting with:

Move d7 from a to c.

Now, peg a: d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6

Peg b: empty

Peg c: d7

Next, move d6 from a to b.

Peg a: d1, d2, d3, d4, d5

Peg b: d6

Peg c: d7

Then, move d7 from c to b, on top of d6.

But wait, d7 is lighter than d6, so I can place d7 on d6.

Peg a: d1, d2, d3, d4, d5

Peg b: d6, d7

Peg c: empty

Now, move d5 from a to c.

Peg a: d1, d2, d3, d4

Peg b: d6, d7

Peg c: d5

Then, move d7 from b to a.

Peg a: d1, d2, d3, d4, d7

Peg b: d6

Peg c: d5

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Now d7 is on top of d4 on peg a, which is fine since d7 is lighter.

Next, move d6 from b to c, on top of d5.

But d6 is heavier than d5, so I can't place d6 on d5. That's a problem.

Wait, maybe I shouldn't have moved d7 to b in the previous step.

Let me backtrack.

After moving d7 to b on top of d6, I have:

Peg a: d1, d2, d3, d4, d5

Peg b: d6, d7

Peg c: empty

Now, if I move d5 from a to c.

Peg a: d1, d2, d3, d4

Peg b: d6, d7

Peg c: d5

Then, move d4 from a to b, on top of d7.

Wait, d4 is heavier than d7, so that's allowed.

Peg a: d1, d2, d3

Peg b: d6, d7, d4

Peg c: d5

Next, move d3 from a to c, on top of d5.

But d3 is lighter than d5, which is not allowed, since d3 is lighter and can't be placed on d5.

Wait, the problem says "a disk cannot be moved onto another if it is heavier than it." So, heavier disks can be placed on lighter ones, but not vice versa.

Wait, no. Let's read the problem again: "A disk cannot be moved onto another if it is heavier than it." So, you can't place a heavier disk on a lighter one, which means only lighter disks can be placed on heavier ones.

So, in this case, d3 is lighter than d5, so I can't place d3 on d5.

Wait, that can't be right. If d5 is on peg c, and d3 is lighter, I can't place d3 on d5.

But in the standard Tower of Hanoi, you can only place smaller (lighter, assuming size correlates with weight) disks on larger ones.

Wait, perhaps there's a confusion in terminology.

In the standard Tower of Hanoi, disks are of different sizes, and you can only place a smaller disk on a larger one, not the other way around.

In this problem, it's stated in terms of weight: "A disk cannot be moved onto another if it is heavier than it."

So, "cannot be moved onto another if it is heavier than it" means that you cannot place a heavier disk onto a lighter one, which is consistent with the size rule in the standard Tower of Hanoi.

Therefore, lighter disks can be placed on heavier disks, but not the other way around.

So, in my current state:

Peg a: d1, d2, d3, d4

Peg b: d6, d7, d4

Peg c: d5

I need to move d3 from a to somewhere. But I can't place it on c because d5 is heavier, and d3 is lighter, so that's not allowed.

Wait, no, the rule is "cannot be moved onto another if it is heavier than it." So, d3 is lighter than d5, so it can be moved onto d5.

Wait, hold on. Let's re-express the rule more clearly.

The rule is: "A disk cannot be moved onto another if it is heavier than it."

Which means: You can only move a disk onto another disk if the disk you're moving is lighter than the one it's being placed on.

So, since d3 is lighter than d5, it can be placed on d5.

Wait, but earlier I thought that you can't place a lighter disk on a heavier one, but that's not what the rule says.

The rule says you cannot move a disk onto another if it is heavier than it.

In other words, you cannot place a heavier disk onto a lighter one.

So, you can place a lighter disk onto a heavier one.

Therefore, in this state, d3 can be placed on d5 because d3 is lighter than d5.

So, continuing:

Move d3 from a to c, on top of d5.

Peg a: d1, d2

Peg b: d6, d7, d4

Peg c: d5, d3

Next, move d2 from a to b, on top of d4.

But d2 is lighter than d4, which should be allowed.

Wait, d2 is lighter than d4, so can I place d2 on d4?

According to the rule, since d2 is lighter than d4, it's allowed.

So, move d2 from a to b, on top of d4.

Peg a: d1

Peg b: d6, d7, d4, d2

Peg c: d5, d3

Next, move d1 from a to c, on top of d3.

But d1 is heavier than d3, so that should be allowed.

Wait, d1 is heavier than d3, so placing d1 on d3 should be fine, since heavier disks can be placed on lighter ones.

So, move d1 from a to c, on top of d3.

Wait, but d3 is already on d5, and d5 is on c.

d5 is heavier than d3, which is fine, and d3 is heavier than d1? Wait, d1 is the heaviest, so d1 is heavier than d3.

Wait, no, the ordering is d1 (heaviest), d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7 (lightest).

So, d1 is heavier than d3, but d3 is on d5, and d5 is on c.

d5 is heavier than d3, which is fine.

Now, placing d1 on d3 would violate the rule because d1 is heavier than d3.

Wait, according to the rule: "A disk cannot be moved onto another if it is heavier than it."

Since d1 is heavier than d3, I cannot place d1 on d3.

Oh, that's a problem.

So, I need to find another move.

Perhaps I should move d3 off of d5 before moving d1 to c.

Wait, but where can I move d3?

If I move d3 off of d5, I need to place it somewhere.

I could move d3 to b, on top of d2, since d3 is lighter than d2.

Wait, d3 is lighter than d2? Let's see:

Order: d1 (heaviest), d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7 (lightest).

So, d2 is heavier than d3.

Therefore, d3 is lighter than d2, so I can place d3 on d2.

So, move d3 from c to b, on top of d2.

Peg a: empty

Peg b: d6, d7, d4, d2, d3

Peg c: d5

Now, move d1 from a to c.

Peg a: empty

Peg b: d6, d7, d4, d2, d3

Peg c: d5, d1

Then, move d3 from b to c, on top of d1.

But d3 is lighter than d1, which is not allowed.

Wait, according to the rule, I cannot place d3 on d1 because d3 is lighter than d1.

Wait, no, the rule is "cannot be moved onto another if it is heavier than it."

So, if d3 is lighter than d1, it can be moved onto d1.

Wait, but earlier I thought otherwise.

Let me re-read the rule again: "A disk cannot be moved onto another if it is heavier than it."

Which means you can only place a disk on another if it is lighter than the target disk.

So, since d3 is lighter than d1, it can be placed on d1.

Therefore, move d3 from b to c, on top of d1.

Peg a: empty

Peg b: d6, d7, d4, d2

Peg c: d5, d1, d3

Next, move d2 from b to a.

Peg a: d2

Peg b: d6, d7, d4

Peg c: d5, d1, d3

Then, move d4 from b to c, on top of d3.

But d4 is heavier than d3, so that's allowed.

Peg a: d2

Peg b: d6, d7

Peg c: d5, d1, d3, d4

Next, move d7 from b to a, on top of d2.

Peg a: d2, d7

Peg b: d6

Peg c: d5, d1, d3, d4

Then, move d6 from b to c, on top of d4.

But d6 is heavier than d4, which is allowed.

Peg a: d2, d7

Peg b: empty

Peg c: d5, d1, d3, d4, d6

Now, move d7 from a to b.

Peg a: d2

Peg b: d7

Peg c: d5, d1, d3, d4, d6

Then, move d2 from a to c, on top of d6.

But d2 is lighter than d6, which is not allowed.

Wait, d2 is lighter than d6? Let's check the ordering again.

d1 (heaviest), d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7 (lightest).

So, d2 is heavier than d3, d4, d5, d6, d7.

Therefore, d2 is heavier than d6, so it can be placed on d6.

So, move d2 from a to c, on top of d6.

Peg a: empty

Peg b: d7

Peg c: d5, d1, d3, d4, d6, d2

Finally, move d7 from b to c, on top of d2.

But d7 is lighter than d2, which is allowed.

Peg a: empty

Peg b: empty

Peg c: d5, d1, d3, d4, d6, d2, d7

Wait, but the desired final order is d1 at the bottom, up to d7 at the top, all on peg c.

But in this state, peg c has d5, d1, d3, d4, d6, d2, d7.

That's not the correct order.

So, clearly, I've messed up somewhere.

I think I need a better approach.

Maybe I should stick to the standard Tower of Hanoi algorithm.

So, for moving 7 disks from a to c, using b as auxiliary, the steps are:

1. Move the top 6 disks from a to b, using c as auxiliary.

2. Move the largest disk (d1) from a to c.

3. Move the 6 disks from b to c, using a as auxiliary.

But moving 6 disks is still a lot. Maybe I can consider moving 3 disks at a time.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a pattern in the moves.

In the standard Tower of Hanoi, the minimal solution involves 2^n - 1 moves, where n is the number of disks.

For 7 disks, that's 127 moves, which is too many to list here.

Maybe I can just describe the general plan.

So, the plan would be to recursively apply the Tower of Hanoi steps:

To move n disks from a to c, using b as auxiliary:

- Move n-1 disks from a to b, using c as auxiliary.

- Move the nth disk from a to c.

- Move the n-1 disks from b to c, using a as auxiliary.

Applying this for n=7 would eventually lead to the solution, but it's too cumbersome to write out all steps.

Perhaps I can provide the general plan and trust that it will work.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more efficient way for this specific problem.

Wait, the problem mentions that disks are already stacked in order from heaviest to lightest on peg a, and I need to move them to peg c in the same order.

So, it's essentially the standard Tower of Hanoi problem, where the goal is to move the entire stack from one peg to another, maintaining the order.

Therefore, the standard solution applies.

Given that, I can conclude that following the recursive steps of the Tower of Hanoi will solve this problem in 127 moves.

Since listing all 127 moves is impractical, I'll consider the plan to be the recursive algorithm described above.

However, to make it more concrete, maybe I can show the first few steps and the general pattern.

First, move the top 6 disks from a to b, using c as auxiliary.

This sub-problem is to move 6 disks from a to b, using c as auxiliary.

To do that:

1. Move the top 5 disks from a to c, using b as auxiliary.

2. Move the 6th disk from a to b.

3. Move the 5 disks from c to b, using a as auxiliary.

And so on, recursively, until reaching the base case of moving one disk.

Then, move d1 from a to c.

Finally, move the 6 disks from b to c, using a as auxiliary, following the same recursive pattern.

This process will eventually result in all disks being on peg c in the correct order.

So, in summary, the plan is to follow the standard Tower of Hanoi recursive algorithm to move all 7 disks from peg a to peg c, using peg b as auxiliary, ensuring that at no point a heavier disk is placed on a lighter one.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Follow the standard Tower of Hanoi recursive algorithm to move all 7 disks from peg a to peg c, using peg b as auxiliary.}}
