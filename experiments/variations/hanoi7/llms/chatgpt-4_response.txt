To solve this problem, you can use the classic recursive algorithm for the Tower of Hanoi problem, which involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another using an auxiliary peg. Each move must follow these rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty peg.
Given that there are 7 disks in total, ordered from heaviest (d1) to lightest (d7) with all disks initially on peg a and the goal is to move them to peg c, let's break down the steps.

Steps to Move 7 Disks from Peg A to Peg C using Peg B as Auxiliary
Move 6 disks from peg A to peg B, using peg C as auxiliary.
This is a recursive step where you first move the top 6 lighter disks (d2 to d7) to peg B, so that you can move the heaviest disk (d1) afterwards.
Move the heaviest disk (d1) from peg A to peg C.
Now that all smaller disks are on peg B, you can move the bottom disk (d1) directly to peg C.
Move the 6 disks from peg B to peg C, using peg A as auxiliary.
Finally, move the 6 disks from peg B to peg C, effectively stacking them on top of d1.
These steps recursively apply the same strategy to move smaller subsets of disks until only one disk needs to be moved directly. Let's break down the first recursive step to illustrate:

Recursive Breakdown for Step 1 (Move 6 Disks from A to B)
Move 5 disks from A to C using B.
Move d2 from A to B.
Move 5 disks from C to B using A.
Repeating this pattern of recursion allows for all disks to be moved according to the rules specified. Would you like to see a detailed breakdown of each move for the entire process, or would you like assistance with any specific part of the algorithm?
