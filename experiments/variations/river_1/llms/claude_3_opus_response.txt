Initial state:

LeftBank: snake, cheese
RightBank: mouse, boat
Step 1: Take the mouse from RightBank to LeftBank.

LeftBank: snake, cheese, mouse
RightBank: boat
Step 2: Take the cheese from LeftBank to RightBank.

Step 3: Take the mouse from LeftBank to RightBank.

Step 4: Take the snake from LeftBank to RightBank.

Final state:
