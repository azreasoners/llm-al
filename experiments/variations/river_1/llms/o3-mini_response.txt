Alright, we have the initial positions: snake and cheese on the left bank, mouse and boat on the right. The boat allows one item per trip, and the human is always with it. We can't leave the snake and mouse unsupervised on a bank, or the snake will eat the mouse. Similarly, we can't leave the mouse and cheese unsupervised, or the mouse will eat the cheese. I’m drawing parallels to the classic “wolf, goat, cabbage” puzzle. Now, let’s figure out the solution step by step.

Okay, let’s break this down carefully. The boat can only carry one item at a time, but it’s always with the human, so that’s not an issue. If the boat goes from the right bank to the left, it’s safe because the bank is supervised—human and boat are always together. Starting with the left bank (snake, cheese) and right bank (mouse, boat), I think we can bring cheese to the right. The key here is ensuring the snake and mouse are never left together. Let’s check the next step.

Okay, I need to carefully think through the steps. If I bring cheese from left to right, then the boat arrives with human — everything’s safe. But when the boat returns, leaving mouse and cheese unsupervised, that's problematic because the mouse could eat the cheese. Similarly, bringing the snake first doesn’t work either because of the same issue with the mouse and snake. I think swapping roles and following a strategy similar to the classical wolf-goat-cabbage puzzle might help. Let's focus on moving the mouse initially.

Here's one solution step-by-step:

Boat crosses empty from RightBank to LeftBank.
Now on LeftBank: snake, cheese, boat, human
Now on RightBank: mouse

Carry the snake from LeftBank to RightBank.
Now on LeftBank: cheese
Now on RightBank: snake, mouse, boat, human
(Since you're present, the snake won’t harm the mouse during the crossing.)

Return from RightBank to LeftBank with the mouse.
Now on LeftBank: cheese, mouse, boat, human
Now on RightBank: snake
(This prevents leaving the snake and mouse together unsupervised on the RightBank.)

Carry the cheese from LeftBank to RightBank.
Now on LeftBank: mouse
Now on RightBank: snake, cheese, boat, human
(The cheese is safe with the snake, as there's no dangerous interaction.)

Return empty from RightBank to LeftBank.
Now on LeftBank: mouse, boat, human
Now on RightBank: snake, cheese

Carry the mouse from LeftBank to RightBank.
Now on LeftBank: (empty)
Now on RightBank: snake, cheese, mouse, boat, human

All three items have been safely transported to the RightBank without any risk of the snake eating the mouse or the mouse eating the cheese.
