To solve this problem, the plan needs to ensure that at no point the mouse is left alone with the cheese, or the snake with the mouse without the presence of the human (you). Since the boat can carry only one item (mouse, snake, or cheese) at a time and starts with the mouse and boat on the right bank, we need to ferry each across to the left bank and then back to the right bank strategically. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step plan:

Start Configuration:
LeftBank: Snake, Cheese
RightBank: Mouse, Boat
Step 1: Row to the LeftBank.
Action: You (and the boat) go to the LeftBank.
Result:
LeftBank: Snake, Cheese, You, Boat
RightBank: Mouse
Step 2: Take the Snake to the RightBank.
Action: Take the Snake, leave the Cheese.
Result:
LeftBank: Cheese
RightBank: Mouse, Snake, You, Boat
Step 3: Return to the LeftBank alone.
Action: Leave the Snake and Mouse on the RightBank, row back alone.
Result:
LeftBank: Cheese, You, Boat
RightBank: Mouse, Snake
Step 4: Take the Cheese to the RightBank.
Action: Take the Cheese.
Result:
LeftBank:
RightBank: Mouse, Snake, Cheese, You, Boat
All items (mouse, snake, cheese) and you with the boat are now on the RightBank, successfully transported without any incidents of one eating the other.
