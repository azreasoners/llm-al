% Generated constraints

% 1. Moving the boat to a side causes the location of the boat to be that side.
moveBoat(S) causes loc(boat) = S.

% 2. Moving the boat to a side causes the location of any item on the boat to be that side.
moveBoat(S) causes loc(T1) = S if onBoat(T1).

% 3. Moving the boat is not executable if the boat is already on that side.
nonexecutable moveBoat(S) if loc(boat) = S.

% 4. Boarding the boat with an item causes the item to be on the boat.
boardBoat(T1) causes onBoat(T1).

% 5. Boarding the boat with an item causes the location of the item to be the same as the boat's location.
boardBoat(T1) causes loc(T1) = loc(boat).

% 6. Boarding the boat is not executable if the item is already on the boat.
nonexecutable boardBoat(T1) if onBoat(T1).

% 7. Boarding the boat is not executable if the item is not on the same side as the boat.
nonexecutable boardBoat(T1) if loc(T1) \= loc(boat).

% 8. Boarding the boat is not executable if there is already an item on the boat.
nonexecutable boardBoat(T1) if onBoat(T2) & T1 \= T2.

% 9. Unboarding an item from the boat causes the item to not be on the boat.
unboardBoat(T1) causes ~onBoat(T1).

% 10. Unboarding an item from the boat causes the location of the item to remain the same as the boat's location.
unboardBoat(T1) causes loc(T1) = loc(boat).

% 11. Unboarding an item is not executable if the item is not on the boat.
nonexecutable unboardBoat(T1) if ~onBoat(T1).

% 12. It is impossible for more than one item to be on the boat at the same time.
impossible onBoat(T1) & onBoat(T2) & T1 \= T2.

% 13. If the snake and the mouse are left alone on a side without the boat, then the snake eats the mouse.
impossible loc(mouse) = S & loc(snake) = S & loc(boat) \= S & ~onBoat(mouse) & ~onBoat(snake).

% 14. If the mouse and the cheese are left alone on a side without the boat, then the mouse eats the cheese.
impossible loc(mouse) = S & loc(cheese) = S & loc(boat) \= S & ~onBoat(mouse) & ~onBoat(cheese).

% 18. A thing's location is the same as the boat's location if it is on the boat.
loc(T1) = loc(boat) if onBoat(T1).

% 19. Moving the boat is not executable if an item is boarding or unboarding the boat at the same time.
