% Query 1: Attempt to move disk d1 to peg c at step 0. Should be unsatisfiable because d1 has d2 on top of it in the initial state. (unsatisfiable)
:- query
    0: loc(d1)=b & loc(d2)=d1 & loc(d3)=c & weight(d1)=3 & weight(d2)=2 & weight(d3)=1;
    0: move(d1,c).

% Query 2: Move disk d2 from d1 to peg c at step 0. Should be satisfiable because d2 can be moved since it has no disk on top. (satisfiable)
:- query
    0: loc(d1)=b & loc(d2)=d1 & loc(d3)=c & weight(d1)=3 & weight(d2)=2 & weight(d3)=1;
    0: move(d2,c).

% Query 3: After moving d2 to c at step 0, move d1 to peg c at step 1. Should be satisfiable because d1 no longer has d2 on top. (satisfiable)
:- query
    0: loc(d1)=b & loc(d2)=d1 & loc(d3)=c & weight(d1)=3 & weight(d2)=2 & weight(d3)=1;
    0: move(d2,c);
    1: move(d1,c).

% Query 4: Attempt to move disk d1 onto disk d3 at step 0. Should be unsatisfiable because d1 is heavier than d3. (unsatisfiable)
:- query
    0: loc(d1)=b & loc(d2)=d1 & loc(d3)=c & weight(d1)=3 & weight(d2)=2 & weight(d3)=1;
    0: move(d1,d3).

% Query 5: Move disk d3 onto disk d2 at step 0. Should be satisfiable because d3 is lighter than d2 and there are no constraints preventing it. (satisfiable)
:- query
    0: loc(d1)=b & loc(d2)=d1 & loc(d3)=c & weight(d1)=3 & weight(d2)=2 & weight(d3)=1;
    0: move(d3,d2).
