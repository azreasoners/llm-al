% constraints/rules

% 1. Moving a disk to a location causes its location to be that location.
move(D,L) causes loc(D)=L.

% 2. Moving a disk is not executable if there is another disk whose location is the disk being moved.
nonexecutable move(D,L) if loc(D1)=D & D1\=D.

% 3. Moving a disk onto another disk is not executable if the moving disk's weight is greater than the destination disk's weight.
nonexecutable move(D,L) if L=D1 & weight(D)>weight(D1).

% 4. Moving a disk onto a location is not executable if there is a disk whose location is the destination location.
nonexecutable move(D,L) if loc(D1)=L & D1\=D.

% 5. A disk cannot be moved onto itself.
nonexecutable move(D,L) if L=D.
