    Solves the Tower of Hanoi problem for n disks.
    The function prints the move required to move n disks from the source peg to the target peg.
    
    Parameters:
        n (int): Number of disks to move.
        source (str): The peg where disks are initially located.
        target (str): The peg where disks should be moved.
        auxiliary (str): The third peg used as a temporary storage.

# Initially, disk d3 is on peg c, disk d1 is on peg b, and disk d2 is on disk d1
# We need to move disks d2 and d1 to peg c

# Move d2 from b (over d1) to a (temporary move to free d1)

STDOUT/STDERR
Move disk from b to a
Move disk from b to c
Move disk from a to c
The program has successfully generated the steps to move all the disks to peg c, given their initial configuration. Here's the solution:

Move disk d2 from peg b to peg a.
Move disk d1 from peg b to peg c.
Move disk d2 from peg a to peg c.
This sequence ensures that all disks end up stacked on peg c, following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. â€‹
