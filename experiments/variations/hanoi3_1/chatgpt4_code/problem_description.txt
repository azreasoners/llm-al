Use the code interpreter to generate a Python program to solve the following problem. Revise the program as many times as needed until the program is correct.

There are three types of things: location, disk, and peg.
disks and pegs are locations.

Problem Description:
To successfully stack disks in a tower, one needs to move disks off of other disks or pegs to achieve the desired ordered stack. A disk cannot be moved if there is another disk on top of it. A disk cannot be moved onto another if it is heavier than it.

There are three disks: d1, d2, and d3. There are three pegs: a, b, and c.

Disk d1 is on peg b. Disk d2 is on disk d1. Disk d3 is on peg c. Find a plan to stack all disks on peg c.
