Okay, so the problem involves three disks (d1, d2, d3) and three pegs (a, b, c). Right now, d1 is on peg b, d2 on d1, and d3 on peg c. We need to move all the disks to peg c, but there are rules: A disk can’t be moved if something’s on top of it, and a heavier disk can’t be placed on a lighter one.

Hmm, I need to make sure these conditions apply accurately in each move step.

Okay, here's the situation: we need to move disks in the right order: d1 (heaviest) at the bottom, d2 in the middle, and d3 (lightest) on top — all on peg c.

So, currently: d1 and d2 are on peg b, and d3 is on peg c. The tricky part is d1 being too heavy to move until d2 is off, but we also need to follow the rule that heavier disks can’t be placed on lighter ones.

Let’s figure out step-by-step moves to solve this!

I’m trying to figure out the best way to move the disks. The main issue is that d1 is too heavy for peg c, where d3 is already located, as we can’t move a heavier disk on top of a lighter one.

The first step is to move d2 to peg a, then d1 is free. I can’t place d1 on peg c with d3 because of the weight rule, so I need to move d3. Moving d3 to peg a is allowed since it's lighter than d2.

Below is one valid plan. We’ll denote a move as “move X from Y to Z.”

Initial configuration:

Peg a: empty
Peg b: d1 with d2 on top
Peg c: d3
Remember that the disks’ weights are: d1 (heaviest), then d2, and d3 (lightest). Also, a disk can only be moved if nothing is on top of it, and you cannot place a heavier disk on top of a lighter one.

Step-by-step Moves:

Move d2 from peg b to peg a.
Reason: d2 is on top of d1, so it’s the only disk that can be moved. Peg a is empty.

Move d3 from peg c to peg a.
Reason: We need to free peg c so that later d1 (the heaviest) can be moved there. d3 (the lightest) can be placed on top of d2 because d3 is lighter.

Move d1 from peg b to peg c.
Reason: With d2 removed from on top, d1 is now free to move. Peg c is empty.

Move d3 from peg a to peg b.
Reason: This clears peg a so that d2 becomes free, and peg b is available for d3. (Moving d3 directly onto d1 on peg c isn’t advisable because we need d2 to eventually go on peg c with d1 at the bottom.)

Move d2 from peg a to peg c.
Reason: d2 can be placed on d1 (since d1 is heavier). This gives the partial stack d1 (bottom) and d2 (top) on peg c.

Move d3 from peg b to peg c.
Reason: Finally, d3 is moved on top of d2. Since d3 is the lightest, it can be placed on d2.

Final configuration on peg c:
Bottom: d1, Middle: d2, Top: d3

This sequence respects both the rule that a disk cannot be moved if another disk is on top, and that you cannot place a heavier disk onto a lighter one.
