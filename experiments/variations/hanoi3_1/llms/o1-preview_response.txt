Figuring out disk stacking

I'm starting with the rules and initial setup: disks can't go onto disks heavier than them, and they must be above other disks to move.

Charting the initial state

First, I’m laying out the initial configuration of Pegs A, B, and C to understand the problem. Disk weights are crucial for determining permissible moves.

Examining constraints

I'm working through the Tower of Hanoi problem, noting the sizes and height relationships of disks. The largest disk must be at the bottom, and smaller ones stacked on top. Constraints prevent moving a disk if heavier disks are on top or being moved onto them.

Strategizing disk movements

Wondering how to reposition disk d2 without violating the rule of never placing a heavier disk on a lighter one. Considering the optimal location to move d2 for easier access to d1.

Assessing movement options

I’m thinking through the potential movement of disk d2 onto peg a, considering that moving it onto peg c or d3 might not comply with the game rules due to constraints.

Evaluating the action

OK, let me see. Moving disk d1 onto peg c might be tricky since peg c holds disk d3. I need to check if d3 is lighter than or equal to d1 to proceed.

Evaluating potential moves

Hm, that's interesting. Placing d1 on a peg with d3 might not work since d1 needs to be light enough to stack on d3. Additionally, d2 and d3 can't bear d1's weight either.

Taking a closer look

I’m working through the puzzle of arranging disks on pegs. Considering if moving a smaller disk onto a larger one or clearing a peg for future moves is ideal.

Revising the strategy

I’m re-evaluating the method for moving disks by shifting d2 to peg a, moving d3 to peg b, and then relocating d1 to peg c. Assuming d3 is lighter than d1, d3 can be placed on d1.

Revisiting the strategy

I’m mapping out an alternative approach where I move d3 to peg a and then shift d2 to peg c, freeing up d1. This makes me think about new possibilities.

Revising the strategy

OK, let me see. Moving d1 onto d2 is too risky. Instead, I’ll shift d3 to peg a, then move d2 to peg c, freeing d1 for further action.

Adapting Tower of Hanoi

I'm considering the Tower of Hanoi problem's rules to ensure a heavier disk isn't placed on a lighter one. If direct moves don't work, I'm thinking about intermediate steps to progress.

Mapping the setup

I’m figuring out the initial disk distribution and the goal: move d1 and d2 to peg c, following the Tower of Hanoi constraints.

Revisiting the strategy

I’m thinking about different ways to move discs so that no heavier disc sits atop a lighter one. Peg a is now a potential spot for the heavier disc.

Rearranging the disks

I’m strategizing how to free peg c by shifting disks around. This involves moving d3 to peg b, d1 to peg c, and then placing d2 on d1, considering weight constraints.

Reassessing the strategy

I’m mapping the current peg configuration and considering the constraints of disk weight. The stack needs to be non-decreasing from bottom to top.

Reorganizing the arrangement

I’m working on a new plan to shift d3 onto d2. By moving d3 to peg a, followed by rearranging d2 and d3 on peg c, I ensure d3 is lighter and seated on d2.

Recalculating moves

OK, let's see. Peg a's empty now because of the last move on peg c. I’m thinking about shifting d1 from peg b to peg a, then relocating d3 from d2 to peg c.

Crafting the strategy

I'm mapping out a specific plan for the Tower of Hanoi, moving disks in ascending size to a target peg from bottom to top. This approach addresses the unique starting state.

Aligning the pegs

I’m arranging pegs, placing disks by size. Lighter disks go on top, ensuring the correct order of movement.

Managing the pegs

I’m arranging the disks onto Peg C, making sure Peg B holds D1 before moving D2 and D3 to Peg A, and then transferring D1 to Peg C.

Transferring disks

I moved disk 3 from peg a to peg b, then disk 2 from peg a to peg c. Finally, disk 3 went from peg b to peg c, aligning with the rules.

To solve this problem, we'll need to carefully plan the sequence of disk moves while adhering to the given constraints:

A disk cannot be moved if there is another disk on top of it.
A disk cannot be moved onto another disk if it is heavier than it.
We'll assume the disks are ordered by weight, with d1 being the heaviest, followed by d2, and d3 being the lightest.

Initial State:

Peg A: Empty
Peg B: d1 (bottom), d2 (top)
Peg C: d3
Goal State:

Peg C: d1 (bottom), d2, d3 (top)
Step-by-Step Plan:

Move d2 from d1 (Peg B) to Peg A.

Reasoning: d2 is on top of d1, so we can move it. Peg A is empty.
State:
Peg A: d2
Peg B: d1
Peg C: d3
Move d3 from Peg C onto d2 on Peg A.

Reasoning: d3 is lighter than d2, so we can place it on top of d2.
State:
Peg A: d2 (bottom), d3 (top)
Peg B: d1
Peg C: Empty
Move d1 from Peg B to Peg C.

Reasoning: d1 is the only disk on Peg B and Peg C is empty.
State:
Peg A: d2, d3
Peg B: Empty
Peg C: d1
Move d3 from d2 (Peg A) to Peg B.

Reasoning: d3 is on top of d2, so we can move it. Peg B is empty.
State:
Peg A: d2
Peg B: d3
Peg C: d1
Move d2 from Peg A onto d1 on Peg C.

Reasoning: d2 is lighter than d1, so we can place it on top of d1.
State:
Peg A: Empty
Peg B: d3
Peg C: d1 (bottom), d2 (top)
Move d3 from Peg B onto d2 on Peg C.

Reasoning: d3 is lighter than d2, so we can place it on top of d2.
Final State:
Peg A: Empty
Peg B: Empty
Peg C: d1 (bottom), d2, d3 (top)
Final Result:

All disks are stacked on Peg C in the correct order, complying with the movement constraints.

Summary of Moves:

move(d2, Peg B, Peg A)
move(d3, Peg C, Peg A)
move(d1, Peg B, Peg C)
move(d3, Peg A, Peg B)
move(d2, Peg A, Peg C)
move(d3, Peg B, Peg C)
This plan successfully stacks all disks on Peg C following the rules provided.

Answer:

A step-by-step plan to stack all disks on peg c:

Move d2 from d1 to peg a.
Move d3 from peg c onto d2 on peg a.
Move d1 from peg b to peg c.
Move d3 from d2 (on peg a) to peg b.
Move d2 from peg a onto d1 on peg c.
Move d3 from peg b onto d2 on peg c.
