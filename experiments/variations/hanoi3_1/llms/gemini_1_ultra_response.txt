Here's how you can solve the problem of stacking all disks on peg 'c' and the steps involved:

Understanding the Rules:

One Move at a Time: You can only move one disk at a time.
Top Disk Only: You can only move the disk that is at the top of a stack (peg or disk).
Size Restriction: You cannot place a larger (heavier) disk on top of a smaller one.
Initial Setup:

Peg a: Empty
Peg b: d1 (bottom), d2 (top)
Peg c: d3
Goal:

Peg a: Empty
Peg b: Empty
Peg c: d1 (bottom), d2, d3 (top)
Plan:

Move d2 from b to a: Now you can access d1.
Move d1 from b to c: Now you can build the final tower.
Move d2 from a to c: Smaller disk d2 is on top of d1.
Move d3 from c to b: This temporarily frees peg c.
Move d1 from c to a: Move d1 out of the way.
Move d3 from b to c: Place the largest disk at its final position.
Move d1 from a to c: Complete the tower on peg c.
