Thought about disk stacking strategy for 49 seconds
Mapping the disks

OK, let me see. We have three disks of increasing weight from d1 to d3. Disks will be moved from pegs b and c to peg a, matching the desired arrangement in terms of weight.

Mapping the sequence

I’m thinking through the move from peg b to peg a. Since d2 on top of d1 can’t go to d3, it’s gotta be placed on the empty peg a.

Revisiting the strategy

OK, I’m rethinking the priority of disk movements to align with each disk's weight. This involves putting lighter disks on top of heavier ones and continuing the process to peg a.

Confirming constraints

I’m mapping out that a lighter disk can only be placed on top of a heavier one, ensuring the final stack has d1 on the bottom, d2 in the middle, and d3 on top.

Organizing the move

I’m thinking through moving d2 to peg a so d1 can reach peg c. Then, d2 will go on top of d1 in peg c, followed by d3.

Revealing the approach

First, move d2 from peg b to peg a to free d3. Then, place d1 on peg c, put d2 on top of d1, and finally add d3 to the peg c stack.

Revisiting the approach

I realized d1 can't go on top of d3 due to weight constraints. So, I'll first relocate d3 and then position d1 on peg c, stacking it correctly afterward.

Reiterating constraints

I’m clarifying that d3, being the lightest, can't be placed on heavier disks like d1 or d2. I’m now ensuring the correct movement of disks while adhering to these rules.

Clarifying placement rules

Hmm, I’m thinking about lifting a lighter disk onto a heavier one just in time. This resolves the confusion and guides us towards the correct disk movement.

Moving d3 to free space

OK, let me see. I’m working on placing d3 on peg a or b to clear peg c for d1, ensuring everything adheres to the weight constraints for proper stacking.

Ensuring placement

I’m confirming that placing d3 on top of d2 is permissible since d3 is lighter. This leads me to clear up any confusion about the exact placement of the disks.

Confirming disk movement

I’ve established that d3 can go on top of d2 since it's lighter. This avoids confusion about stacking rules and ensures all constraints are met.

Confirming the process

OK, since there's no rule against placing a disk on another, and considering the weight constraints, placing d3 on d2 or d1 is permissible. This clears up any confusion about disk placements.

Confirming the rules

I’m working through the Tower of Hanoi rules, confirming that a disk can go on top of a bigger disk or an empty peg, without a specific rule against placing a disk on another.

Confirming the rules

I’m aligning the rules with the Tower of Hanoi, where placing a disk on a larger one or an empty peg is allowed. This ensures proper stacking without requiring the underlying disk to be free.

Confirming the guidelines

OK, I'm noting that in the Tower of Hanoi, a disk can go onto a larger one or an empty peg, without needing the disk beneath to be free.

Analyzing put-and-place rules

I’m considering the Tower of Hanoi logic, which permits placing a disk on a larger one or an empty peg, ensuring valid stack operations.

Strategizing the next steps

I’m focusing on relocating d3 to peg b, freeing up peg c, and validly accessing d1 for transport to peg c. This method ensures a systematic progression.

Strategizing disk removal

I’m working through freeing up d1 by relocating d3 to peg a or c. To ensure a consistent and organized approach, all movements will align with the Tower of Hanoi rules.

Reworking the strategy

I’m rethinking the disk movement plan: first, shift d2 and d3 from peg b to peg a. Then, relocate d1 from b to c, adhering to the Tower of Hanoi rules for effective stacking.

Organizing the moves

I’m aligning d3 to peg a, then d2 to peg c, and finally d3 to peg c. This process ensures all moves respect the Tower of Hanoi rules.

Strategizing peg c

I’m ensuring peg c is clear to move d1 there, considering weight constraints and the need for a stack, leading to an optimal solution.

Crafting a plan

I’m pulling together a sequence for moving disks into the optimal peg c stack by systematically freeing peg elements and placing them in a weight-adhering order.

Moving pieces around

I’m figuring out how to set d2 onto pig a since it's ready for action, leaving d1 free for the next move.

Organizing the stack

I’m thinking through the step-by-step process of relocating d2 to peg a and ensuring d1 bypasses d3 on peg c, all in line with the Tower of Hanoi rules.

Lifting weights

OK, so I'm lifting d3 from peg c and placing it on peg a, which is clear. This move fits the Tower of Hanoi rules and frees up peg c for further action.

Placing discs in their rightful places

First, I set d3 on peg a above d2, clearing peg c. Then, with peg c empty, I smoothly moved d1 into position there.

Clearing the way

I’m shifting d3 from peg a to peg b to free up peg c for d1, ensuring the correct stacking order in the Tower of Hanoi.

Adjusting my approach

I’m placing d3 on peg b to free up peg a, then shifting d2 from peg a to peg c, stacking it atop d1. Finally, I’m moving d3 to peg c on top of d2.

Shifting and stacking

I’m working through relocating d3 to peg b to clear peg a for d2. D2 will then go to peg c, above d1. Finally, d3 will join d2 on peg c.

Organizing the stack

I'm making sure lighter disk d3 stays atop d2. This confirms the right positioning, meeting the Tower of Hanoi rules where a spanning disk can't go on a smaller one.

Analysis

We have three disks:

𝑑

d 
1
​
  (heaviest)
𝑑
2
d 
2
​
  (middle)
𝑑
3
d 
3
​
  (lightest)
and three pegs:

𝑎
a
𝑏
b
𝑐
c
Initially:

On peg 
𝑏
b:

𝑑

d

​

d

​
 
On peg 
𝑐
c:

𝑑
3
d 
3
​
 
On peg 
𝑎
a:

(empty)
The goal is to end with *all disks on peg (c)* in the correct order (heaviest at the bottom):

Final on peg 
𝑐

𝑑

Final on peg c: 
d 
3
​
  (top)
d

​
 
d

​
  (bottom)
​
 
under the rules:

You can only move the topmost disk from any peg.
You may place a disk 
𝑋
X on top of another disk 
𝑌
Y only if 
𝑋
X is lighter than 
𝑌
Y. Equivalently, you cannot place disk 
𝑋
X on 
𝑌
Y if 
𝑋
X is heavier than 
𝑌
Y.
You may always place a disk onto an empty peg (since there is no conflict of weight).

Step-by-Step Plan

Below is one valid sequence of moves (there are others, but this is a straightforward approach):

Move 
𝑑
2
d 
2
​
  from peg 
𝑏
b to peg 
𝑎
a.

We cannot move 
𝑑
2
d

​
  directly onto 
𝑑
3
d

​
  (on 
𝑐
c) because 
𝑑
2
d 
2
​
  is heavier than 
𝑑
3
d

​
 .
Peg 
𝑎
a is empty, so this move is allowed.
Now:

Move

c to peg 
𝑎
a.

𝑑

d 
3
​
  is lighter than 
𝑑

d

​
 , so it is valid to place 
𝑑
3
d

​
  on top of 
𝑑

d

​
 .
This also frees up peg 
𝑐
c.
Now:

Move 
𝑑

Peg 
𝑐
c is empty, and 
𝑑

​

Now:

peg

​
 
Move 
𝑑
3
d

​
  from peg

b.

We must free 
𝑑
2
d 
2
​
  (which is below 
𝑑
3
d 
3
​
  on peg 
𝑎
a), so we move 
𝑑
3
d 
3
​
  away first.
Peg 
𝑏
b is empty, so 
𝑑
3
d 
3
​
  can go there.
Now:

peg

𝑑

​
 
peg

​
 
Move 
𝑑

​
  from peg

c.

𝑑
1
d 
1
​
  on peg 
𝑐
c is heavier than 
𝑑
2
d

​
 , so it is valid to place 
𝑑
2
d 
2
​
  on top of 
𝑑

d

​
 .
Now:

peg 
𝑎

peg

​
 
peg

Move 
𝑑
3
d

b to peg 
𝑐
c.

𝑑
3
d 
3
​
  is lighter than 
𝑑
2
d 
2
​
 , so we can place 
𝑑
3
d 
3
​
  on top of 
𝑑
2
d

​
 .
Final configuration:

peg

All disks end on peg
