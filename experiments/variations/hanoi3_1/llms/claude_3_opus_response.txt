Here is a plan to stack all the disks on peg c:

Move disk d2 from disk d1 to peg a.
Move disk d1 from peg b to peg c.
Move disk d2 from peg a to peg c.
The resulting state will have disk d1 on peg c, disk d2 on disk d1, and disk d3 on disk d2, with all disks stacked on peg c.

Explanation:

We start by moving the top disk d2 off of d1 and onto the empty peg a. This frees up disk d1 to be moved.
We then move disk d1 from its current peg b onto the target peg c. Now peg c has disks d3 and d1.
Finally, we move disk d2 from peg a onto disk d1 on peg c. This stacks all the disks on peg c in the order d1, d2, d3.
The key points are:

Disks can only be moved one at a time
A disk can only be moved if there is no disk on top of it
A disk can only be moved onto an empty peg or onto a larger disk
The goal is to stack the disks in ascending order on the target peg
