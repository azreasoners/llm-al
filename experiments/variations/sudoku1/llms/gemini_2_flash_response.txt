Logic and Steps (General Sudoku Solving Strategies):

While I can't show every single deduction step-by-step (it would be very lengthy), I can outline the common strategies used to arrive at the solution:

Scanning: Look for rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes that already have several numbers filled in. This limits the possibilities for the remaining empty cells.
Elimination: If a number already exists in a row, column, or 3x3 box, you can eliminate that number as a possibility for the other empty cells in that row, column, or box.
Single Candidate (Naked Single): If a cell can only possibly contain one number based on the existing numbers in its row, column, and 3x3 box, then that number must be placed in that cell.
Hidden Single: If a number can only appear in one cell within a row, column, or 3x3 box (even if other cells in that unit have multiple possibilities), then that number must go in that cell.
Naked Pairs/Triples/etc.: If two (or three, etc.) cells in a row, column, or 3x3 box have the same two (or three, etc.) possible candidates, then those candidates can be eliminated from all other cells in that unit.
Hidden Pairs/Triples/etc.: If two (or three, etc.) numbers can only appear in two (or three, etc.) specific cells within a row, column, or 3x3 box, then those numbers can be eliminated as candidates from all other cells in those two (or three, etc.) cells.
Example (Simplified):

Let's say in a row you have: 1 _ 3 _ 5 _ 7 8 9. The empty cells can only be 2, 4, or 6. If you can further deduce that one of the empty cells cannot be 2 or 4, then it must be 6.

Applying these strategies systematically is how Sudoku puzzles are solved. Because of the interconnected nature of the constraints, filling in one number often creates a chain reaction of deductions that leads to the complete solution.
