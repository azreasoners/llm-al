So I've got this Sudoku puzzle to solve. I'm not super experienced with Sudoku, but I've played enough to understand the basic rules. The goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, making sure that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also called boxes) contains all of the digits exactly once.

From the problem statement, it looks like some cells already have numbers in them, and I need to fill in the rest. Let's see what's given:

- Row 0, Column 0: 8

- Row 1, Column 2: 3

- Row 1, Column 3: 6

- Row 2, Column 1: 7

- Row 2, Column 4: 9

- Row 2, Column 6: 2

- Row 3, Column 1: 5

- Row 3, Column 5: 7

- Row 4, Column 4: 4

- Row 4, Column 5: 5

- Row 4, Column 6: 7

- Row 5, Column 3: 1

- Row 5, Column 7: 3

- Row 6, Column 2: 1

- Row 6, Column 7: 6

- Row 6, Column 8: 8

- Row 7, Column 2: 8

- Row 7, Column 3: 5

- Row 7, Column 7: 1

- Row 8, Column 1: 9

- Row 8, Column 6: 4

First, I should probably visualize the grid to see where the numbers are placed. Since rows and columns are numbered from 0 to 8, I can sketch a 9x9 grid and mark the given numbers.

Let me try to sketch this grid here:

```

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

1 _ _ 3 6 _ _ _ _ _

2 _ 7 _ _ 9 _ 2 _ _

3 _ 5 _ _ _ 7 _ _ _

4 _ _ _ _ 4 5 7 _ _

5 _ _ _ 1 _ _ _ 3 _

6 _ _ 1 _ _ _ 6 8

7 _ _ 8 5 _ _ 1 _ _

8 _ 9 _ _ _ _ 4 _ _

```

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me double-check the given numbers:

- Row 0, Column 0: 8

- Row 1, Column 2: 3

- Row 1, Column 3: 6

- Row 2, Column 1: 7

- Row 2, Column 4: 9

- Row 2, Column 6: 2

- Row 3, Column 1: 5

- Row 3, Column 5: 7

- Row 4, Column 4: 4

- Row 4, Column 5: 5

- Row 4, Column 6: 7

- Row 5, Column 3: 1

- Row 5, Column 7: 3

- Row 6, Column 2: 1

- Row 6, Column 7: 6

- Row 6, Column 8: 8

- Row 7, Column 2: 8

- Row 7, Column 3: 5

- Row 7, Column 7: 1

- Row 8, Column 1: 9

- Row 8, Column 6: 4

Okay, let's try filling in the grid again, making sure to place each number in its correct row and column.

Starting with Row 0: only Column 0 has a number, which is 8.

Row 0: 8 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Row 1: _ _ 3 6 _ _ _ _ _

Row 2: _ 7 _ _ 9 _ 2 _ _

Row 3: _ 5 _ _ _ 7 _ _ _

Row 4: _ _ _ _ 4 5 7 _ _

Row 5: _ _ _ 1 _ _ _ 3 _

Row 6: _ _ 1 _ _ _ 6 8

Row 7: _ _ 8 5 _ _ 1 _ _

Row 8: _ 9 _ _ _ _ 4 _ _

Alright, that looks better. Now, I need to fill in the blanks while ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 box has all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.

I think I'll start with the rows that have the most numbers already filled in, as that might give me more clues.

Looking at Row 0: 8 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Only one number is filled in, so maybe I'll skip that for now.

Row 1: _ _ 3 6 _ _ _ _ _

Two numbers filled in.

Row 2: _ 7 _ _ 9 _ 2 _ _

Three numbers filled in.

Row 3: _ 5 _ _ _ 7 _ _ _

Two numbers filled in.

Row 4: _ _ _ _ 4 5 7 _ _

Three numbers filled in.

Row 5: _ _ _ 1 _ _ _ 3 _

Two numbers filled in.

Row 6: _ _ 1 _ _ _ 6 8

Three numbers filled in.

Row 7: _ _ 8 5 _ _ 1 _ _

Three numbers filled in.

Row 8: _ 9 _ _ _ _ 4 _ _

Two numbers filled in.

Hmm, most rows have only a few numbers filled in, so maybe I should look at columns or boxes instead.

Let's try looking at Column 0:

Row 0: 8

Row 1: _

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: _

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: _

Only Row 0 has a number, which is 8. So, in Column 0, I know that 8 is already used, so the other cells can't have 8.

Similarly, Column 1:

Row 0: _

Row 1: _

Row 2: _

Row 3: _

Row 4: _

Row 5: _

Row 6: _

Row 7: _

Row 8: 9

Only Row 8 has a number, which is 9. So, in Column 1, 9 is used, and the other cells can't have 9.

Continuing this way, I can note which numbers are already used in each column, which will help me determine possible numbers for the empty cells.

But this might take a while, and I'm not sure if there's a more efficient way to approach this.

Alternatively, maybe I can look at the 3x3 boxes.

The grid is divided into nine 3x3 boxes:

- Box 1: Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2

- Box 2: Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5

- Box 3: Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8

- Box 4: Rows 3-5, Columns 0-2

- Box 5: Rows 3-5, Columns 3-5

- Box 6: Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8

- Box 7: Rows 6-8, Columns 0-2

- Box 8: Rows 6-8, Columns 3-5

- Box 9: Rows 6-8, Columns 6-8

Let's consider Box 1: Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2.

Current numbers:

- Row 0, Column 0: 8

- Row 2, Column 1: 7

So, in Box 1, we have 8 and 7 already placed.

Therefore, the remaining numbers in Box 1 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,9.

I can try to find where these numbers can be placed in Box 1.

Looking at the rows and columns that intersect with Box 1:

- Row 0: has 8 in Column 0

- Row 1: has 3 in Column 2 and 6 in Column 3

- Row 2: has 7 in Column 1 and 2 in Column 6

- Column 0: has 8 in Row 0

- Column 1: has 7 in Row 2

- Column 2: has 3 in Row 1

So, in Box 1, the possible numbers for each cell are:

Row 0, Column 0: 8 (already filled)

Row 0, Column 1: can be 1,2,3,4,5,6,9 (since 7 and 8 are already in the box and column)

Row 0, Column 2: can be 1,2,4,5,6,9 (since 3 is in Column 2 in Row 1)

Row 1, Column 0: can be 1,2,4,5,9 (since 6 is in Row 1, Column 3)

Row 1, Column 1: can be 1,2,4,5,9 (since 3 is in Row 1, Column 2)

Row 1, Column 2: 3 (already filled)

Row 2, Column 0: can be 1,2,3,4,5,6,9 (since 7 is in Row 2, Column 1)

Row 2, Column 1: 7 (already filled)

Row 2, Column 2: can be 1,2,4,5,6,9 (since 3 is in Row 1, Column 2)

This seems a bit too scattered. Maybe I should look for cells where only one number can fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for numbers that can only go in one cell within a box.

For example, in Box 1, number 9 is not yet used. Looking at the rows and columns intersecting Box 1:

- Row 0: no 9

- Row 1: no 9

- Row 2: no 9

- Column 0: no 9 except in Row 8, which is outside Box 1

- Column 1: no 9 except in Row 2, which is already filled with 7

- Column 2: no 9 except in Row 1, which has 3

So, 9 can be placed in Box 1 in Row 0, Column 2.

Because Row 0, Column 1 is influenced by Column 1, which has 7 in Row 2, but that doesn't directly affect Row 0, Column 1.

Wait, no. Let's think again.

Actually, in Box 1, Row 0, Column 2 is influenced by Column 2, which has a 3 in Row 1.

So, in Row 0, Column 2, possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,6,9.

But I need to see if 9 is the only possible number in some cell.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look at the entire grid to see where a particular number can go.

Let's try that approach.

Let's take number 1.

I need to find all the cells where 1 can be placed, considering the constraints of rows, columns, and boxes.

Looking at rows:

- Row 0: no 1 yet

- Row 1: no 1 yet

- Row 2: no 1 yet

- Row 3: no 1 yet

- Row 4: no 1 yet

- Row 5: no 1 yet, but Row 5, Column 3 has 1

Wait, Row 5, Column 3 has 1.

Similarly, Row 6, Column 2 has 1.

Row 7: no 1 yet, but Row 7, Column 7 has 1.

Row 8: no 1 yet

So, Row 0, Row 1, Row 2, Row 3, Row 4, Row 5 has 1 in Column 3, Row 6 has 1 in Column 2, Row 7 has 1 in Column 7, and Row 8 has no 1.

Similarly, for columns:

- Column 0: no 1

- Column 1: no 1

- Column 2: has 1 in Row 6, Column 2

- Column 3: has 1 in Row 5, Column 3

- Column 4: no 1

- Column 5: no 1

- Column 6: no 1

- Column 7: has 1 in Row 7, Column 7

- Column 8: no 1

So, in boxes:

- Box 1 (Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2): no 1 yet

- Box 2 (Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5): no 1 yet

- Box 3 (Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8): no 1 yet

- Box 4 (Rows 3-5, Columns 0-2): no 1 yet

- Box 5 (Rows 3-5, Columns 3-5): no 1 yet

- Box 6 (Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8): no 1 yet

- Box 7 (Rows 6-8, Columns 0-2): has 1 in Row 6, Column 2

- Box 8 (Rows 6-8, Columns 3-5): no 1 yet

- Box 9 (Rows 6-8, Columns 6-8): no 1 yet

Wait, but Row 5 has 1 in Column 3, which is in Box 4.

So, Box 4 already has 1.

Similarly, Row 7 has 1 in Column 7, which is in Box 8.

And Row 6 has 1 in Column 2, which is in Box 7.

So, boxes 4, 7, and 8 already have 1.

Therefore, in boxes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9, 1 can still be placed.

Let's look for cells where 1 can be placed in these boxes.

Starting with Box 1: Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2.

- Row 0, Column 0: 8

- Row 0, Column 1: can be 1

- Row 0, Column 2: can be 1

- Row 1, Column 0: can be 1

- Row 1, Column 1: can be 1

- Row 1, Column 2: 3

- Row 2, Column 0: can be 1

- Row 2, Column 1: 7

- Row 2, Column 2: can be 1

So, in Box 1, 1 can be placed in Row 0, Column 1; Row 0, Column 2; Row 1, Column 0; Row 1, Column 1; Row 2, Column 0; Row 2, Column 2.

But I need to check row and column constraints.

Looking at Row 0: no 1 yet

Column 1: no 1 yet

Column 2: no 1 yet, but Column 2 has 3 in Row 1

So, Row 0, Column 1: possible

Row 0, Column 2: possible

Row 1, Column 0: no 1 in Row 1, no 1 in Column 0

Row 1, Column 1: no 1 in Row 1, no 1 in Column 1

Row 2, Column 0: no 1 in Row 2, no 1 in Column 0

Row 2, Column 2: no 1 in Row 2, no 1 in Column 2

So, all these cells are possible for 1.

Is there a way to determine where exactly 1 should go in Box 1?

Maybe I can look at other boxes to see if 1 has to go in a particular cell in Box 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a box where only one cell can accommodate a 1.

Let's check Box 2: Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5.

Current numbers:

- Row 0: no numbers in Columns 3-5

- Row 1: has 6 in Column 3

- Row 2: no numbers in Columns 3-5

So, in Box 2, 1 can be placed in Row 0, Column 3; Row 0, Column 4; Row 0, Column 5; Row 1, Column 4; Row 1, Column 5; Row 2, Column 3; Row 2, Column 4; Row 2, Column 5.

But Row 1, Column 3 has 6, so that's excluded.

Row 2, Column 4 has 9.

So, possible cells for 1 in Box 2 are: Row 0, Column 3; Row 0, Column 4; Row 0, Column 5; Row 1, Column 4; Row 1, Column 5; Row 2, Column 3; Row 2, Column 5.

Now, checking row and column constraints for 1:

- Row 0: no 1 yet

- Row 1: no 1 yet

- Row 2: no 1 yet

- Column 3: has 6 in Row 1, Column 3

- Column 4: has 9 in Row 2, Column 4

- Column 5: no 1 yet

So, in Box 2, possible cells for 1 are:

- Row 0, Column 3: possible

- Row 0, Column 4: possible

- Row 0, Column 5: possible

- Row 1, Column 4: possible

- Row 1, Column 5: possible

- Row 2, Column 3: possible

- Row 2, Column 5: possible

Still too many options. Maybe I should look at another number or another box.

Let's look at Box 3: Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8.

Current numbers:

- Row 0: no numbers in Columns 6-8

- Row 1: no numbers in Columns 6-8

- Row 2: has 2 in Column 6

So, in Box 3, 1 can be placed in Row 0, Column 6; Row 0, Column 7; Row 0, Column 8; Row 1, Column 6; Row 1, Column 7; Row 1, Column 8; Row 2, Column 7; Row 2, Column 8.

But Row 2, Column 6 has 2.

Checking row and column constraints for 1:

- Row 0: no 1 yet

- Row 1: no 1 yet

- Row 2: no 1 yet, but Column 6 has 2, which doesn't affect 1.

- Column 6: has 2 in Row 2, Column 6

- Column 7: no 1 yet

- Column 8: no 1 yet

So, in Box 3, possible cells for 1 are:

- Row 0, Column 6; Row 0, Column 7; Row 0, Column 8

- Row 1, Column 6; Row 1, Column 7; Row 1, Column 8

- Row 2, Column 7; Row 2, Column 8

But Box 3 is part of Row 0, Row 1, Row 2, and Columns 6-8.

Looking at the entire grid, Row 6, Column 2 has 1, and Row 5, Column 3 has 1, which are in different boxes.

But this isn't helping me pinpoint where to place 1 in Box 3.

Maybe I should look at another number or another box.

Let's try Box 4: Rows 3-5, Columns 0-2.

Current numbers:

- Row 3: has 5 in Column 1

- Row 4: no numbers in Columns 0-2

- Row 5: has 1 in Column 3, but that's outside Box 4

So, in Box 4, 1 can be placed in Row 3, Column 0; Row 3, Column 2; Row 4, Column 0; Row 4, Column 1; Row 4, Column 2; Row 5, Column 0; Row 5, Column 1; Row 5, Column 2.

But Row 3, Column 1 has 5.

Checking row and column constraints for 1:

- Row 3: no 1 yet

- Row 4: no 1 yet

- Row 5: has 1 in Column 3, but that's outside Box 4

- Column 0: no 1 yet

- Column 1: has 5 in Row 3, Column 1

- Column 2: no 1 yet

So, possible cells for 1 in Box 4 are:

- Row 3, Column 0; Row 3, Column 2

- Row 4, Column 0; Row 4, Column 1; Row 4, Column 2

- Row 5, Column 0; Row 5, Column 1; Row 5, Column 2

But Row 5 has 1 in Column 3, which is outside Box 4, so that doesn't directly affect Box 4.

Wait, Column 3 in Row 5 has 1, but Column 3 is outside Box 4, so it doesn't affect Box 4 directly.

Therefore, in Box 4, 1 can be placed in any of the cells mentioned above.

Still too many options.

Maybe I should look at Box 5: Rows 3-5, Columns 3-5.

Current numbers:

- Row 3: has 7 in Column 5

- Row 4: has 4 in Column 4, 5 in Column 5, 7 in Column 6

- Row 5: no numbers in Columns 3-5

So, in Box 5, 1 can be placed in Row 3, Column 3; Row 3, Column 4; Row 4, Column 3; Row 4, Column 5; Row 5, Column 3; Row 5, Column 4; Row 5, Column 5.

But Row 3, Column 5 has 7; Row 4, Column 4 has 4; Row 4, Column 5 has 5; Row 4, Column 6 has 7.

Checking row and column constraints for 1:

- Row 3: no 1 yet

- Row 4: no 1 yet

- Row 5: no 1 yet

- Column 3: has 1 in Row 5, Column 3

- Column 4: no 1 yet

- Column 5: no 1 yet

So, in Box 5, possible cells for 1 are:

- Row 3, Column 3; Row 3, Column 4

- Row 4, Column 3; Row 4, Column 5

- Row 5, Column 4; Row 5, Column 5

But Row 5, Column 3 has 1, which is outside Box 5, so it doesn't directly affect Box 5.

Wait, Row 5, Column 3 has 1, which is in Box 4, not Box 5.

So, in Box 5, 1 can be placed in Row 3, Column 3; Row 3, Column 4; Row 4, Column 3; Row 4, Column 5; Row 5, Column 4; Row 5, Column 5.

But Row 5, Column 3 has 1, which is adjacent to Box 5.

Wait, Row 5, Column 3 is in Box 4, not Box 5.

So, it doesn't directly affect Box 5.

Therefore, in Box 5, 1 can be placed in the mentioned cells.

Still, no clear single cell for 1 in Box 5.

Maybe I should look at Box 6: Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8.

Current numbers:

- Row 3: no numbers in Columns 6-8

- Row 4: has 7 in Column 6

- Row 5: no numbers in Columns 6-8

So, in Box 6, 1 can be placed in Row 3, Column 6; Row 3, Column 7; Row 3, Column 8; Row 4, Column 7; Row 4, Column 8; Row 5, Column 6; Row 5, Column 7; Row 5, Column 8.

But Row 4, Column 6 has 7.

Checking row and column constraints for 1:

- Row 3: no 1 yet

- Row 4: no 1 yet

- Row 5: no 1 yet

- Column 6: has 7 in Row 4, Column 6

- Column 7: no 1 yet

- Column 8: no 1 yet

So, possible cells for 1 in Box 6 are:

- Row 3, Column 6; Row 3, Column 7; Row 3, Column 8

- Row 4, Column 7; Row 4, Column 8

- Row 5, Column 6; Row 5, Column 7; Row 5, Column 8

Again, too many options.

Perhaps looking at 1 isn't the best approach right now. Maybe I should try a different number or look for cells where only one number can fit.

Let's try looking for cells that have only one possible number based on the current state of the grid.

Looking at Row 0:

- Column 0: 8

- Column 1: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,9

- Column 2: possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,6,9

- Column 3: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9

- Column 4: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9

- Column 5: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9

- Column 6: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9

- Column 7: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9

- Column 8: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9

Wait, this seems too broad. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Perhaps I can look for cells where only one number can fit due to constraints from rows, columns, and boxes.

Let's try focusing on Box 1 again.

In Box 1, Row 0, Column 0 is 8.

Row 2, Column 1 is 7.

Column 2 has 3 in Row 1.

So, in Box 1, numbers 8 and 7 are already used.

Looking at Row 0:

- Column 0: 8

- Column 1: ?

- Column 2: ?

Looking at Column 1:

- Row 2: 7

- Other rows: no 7

Looking at Column 2:

- Row 1: 3

- Other rows: no 3

Maybe I can try to place number 9 in Box 1, since Row 4, Column 4 has 4, which is outside Box 1.

Wait, Row 4, Column 4 has 4, which is in Box 5.

Similarly, Row 2, Column 4 has 9, which is in Box 2.

Wait, Row 2, Column 4 has 9, which is in Box 2.

So, in Box 1, can I place 9 in Row 0, Column 2?

Let's check:

- Row 0: no 9

- Column 2: no 9

- Box 1: no 9

So, 9 can be placed in Row 0, Column 2.

But is there a certainty that 9 must be there?

Looking at the possibilities:

- In Box 1, 9 can be placed in Row 0, Column 2

- In Box 2, 9 is already in Row 2, Column 4

- In Box 3, no 9 yet

Wait, Row 2, Column 4 has 9, which is in Box 2.

So, in Box 1, 9 can be placed in Row 0, Column 2.

Similarly, in Box 3, 9 can be placed in Row 0, Column 8; Row 1, Column 7; etc.

But perhaps I can confirm if Row 0, Column 2 must be 9.

Looking at Row 0: no numbers except 8 in Column 0

Looking at Column 2: has 3 in Row 1, Column 2

So, in Row 0, Column 2, possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,6,9

But maybe I can look for another number that must be placed in a specific cell.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a number that can only go in one cell within a row or column.

Let's try number 2.

Looking at number 2:

- Row 2, Column 6 has 2

- Row 6, Column 7 has 6, which is not 2

- Row 7, Column 7 has 1, which is not 2

- Row 8, Column 6 has 4, which is not 2

So, in Row 2, Column 6 has 2.

Similarly, in Box 3, Row 0, Column 6; Row 0, Column 7; Row 0, Column 8; Row 1, Column 6; Row 1, Column 7; Row 1, Column 8; Row 2, Column 7; Row 2, Column 8.

But Row 2, Column 6 has 2.

Wait, no, Row 2, Column 6 has 2, which is in Box 3.

So, in Box 3, 2 is already used in Row 2, Column 6.

Therefore, in Box 3, 2 cannot be placed elsewhere.

Wait, but Row 2, Column 6 has 2, which is in Box 3.

So, in Box 3, only Row 2, Column 6 has 2.

Therefore, in Box 3, other cells cannot have 2.

But perhaps I should look for where 2 can be placed in other boxes.

Looking at Box 6: Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8.

- Row 4, Column 6 has 7

- Row 5, Column 6: no 2 yet

- Row 3, Column 6: no 2 yet

- Row 4, Column 7: no 2 yet

- Row 4, Column 8: no 2 yet

- Row 5, Column 7: no 2 yet

- Row 5, Column 8: no 2 yet

So, in Box 6, 2 can be placed in Row 3, Column 6; Row 3, Column 7; Row 3, Column 8; Row 4, Column 7; Row 4, Column 8; Row 5, Column 6; Row 5, Column 7; Row 5, Column 8.

But Row 4, Column 6 has 7, so 2 cannot be there.

Similarly, in Row 4, Column 7 and Row 4, Column 8: no numbers yet.

In Row 5, Column 6: no number yet.

In Row 3, Column 6: no number yet.

Wait, but Row 4, Column 6 has 7, which is outside Box 6.

Wait, no, Row 4, Column 6 is in Box 6.

Wait, Boxes are defined as:

- Box 6: Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8

- Row 4, Column 6 is in Box 6

So, Row 4, Column 6 has 7, so 2 cannot be there.

Therefore, in Box 6, 2 can be placed in Row 3, Column 6; Row 3, Column 7; Row 3, Column 8; Row 4, Column 7; Row 4, Column 8; Row 5, Column 6; Row 5, Column 7; Row 5, Column 8.

But Row 4, Column 6 has 7, so 2 cannot be there.

Wait, but Row 4, Column 6 is already 7, so 2 cannot be in that cell.

Other cells in Box 6 are still possible for 2, provided they don't violate row or column constraints.

This seems too vague. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Perhaps I can look for a cell where only one number can fit.

Let's pick a cell and see what numbers can be placed there.

Looking at Row 0, Column 1:

- Row 0: no numbers except 8 in Column 0

- Column 1: has 7 in Row 2, Column 1

- Box 1: has 8 in Row 0, Column 0 and 7 in Row 2, Column 1

So, possible numbers for Row 0, Column 1 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,9

But that's still too many options.

Let's try Row 0, Column 2:

- Row 0: no numbers except 8 in Column 0

- Column 2: has 3 in Row 1, Column 2

- Box 1: has 8 in Row 0, Column 0 and 7 in Row 2, Column 1

So, possible numbers for Row 0, Column 2 are 1,2,4,5,6,9

Still too many options.

Maybe I should look at Row 1, Column 0:

- Row 1: has 3 in Column 2 and 6 in Column 3

- Column 0: has 8 in Row 0, Column 0

- Box 1: has 8 in Row 0, Column 0 and 7 in Row 2, Column 1

So, possible numbers for Row 1, Column 0 are 1,2,4,5,9

Still multiple options.

This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should try a different strategy.

Perhaps I can try to fill in the grid step by step, making sure not to violate any constraints.

Let me try to fill in Row 0.

Row 0: 8 _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _

I need to place numbers 1-9 without repeating any.

I know that Column 0 has 8, so in Row 0, Column 0 is 8.

Column 1: has 7 in Row 2, Column 1

Column 2: has 3 in Row 1, Column 2

Column 3: has 6 in Row 1, Column 3

Column 4: has 9 in Row 2, Column 4 and 4 in Row 4, Column 4

Column 5: has 7 in Row 3, Column 5 and 5 in Row 4, Column 5

Column 6: has 2 in Row 2, Column 6 and 7 in Row 4, Column 6

Column 7: has 6 in Row 6, Column 7 and 1 in Row 7, Column 7

Column 8: has 8 in Row 6, Column 8

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me try to use the process of elimination for Row 0.

Row 0: 8 _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _

Looking at Box 1 (Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2):

- Row 0, Column 0: 8

- Row 0, Column 1: ?

- Row 0, Column 2: ?

- Row 1, Column 0: ?

- Row 1, Column 1: ?

- Row 1, Column 2: 3

- Row 2, Column 0: ?

- Row 2, Column 1: 7

- Row 2, Column 2: ?

In Box 1, numbers 8 and 7 are already used.

So, possible numbers for Box 1 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,9

Looking at Row 0 specifically:

- Row 0, Column 0: 8

- Row 0, Column 1: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,9

- Row 0, Column 2: possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,6,9 (since Column 2 has 3 in Row 1)

Looking at Column 1:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: 7

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: ?

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: ?

- Row 8: ?

So, in Column 1, 7 is in Row 2.

Therefore, in Row 0, Column 1, possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,9, excluding 7.

But 7 is already excluded since it's in Row 2, Column 1.

Similarly, in Row 0, Column 2, possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,6,9, excluding 3.

Looking at Box 1, if I try to place 9 in Row 0, Column 2:

- Row 0: no 9

- Column 2: no 9

- Box 1: no 9

So, 9 can be placed in Row 0, Column 2.

But maybe I should check if 9 must be there.

Looking at other cells in Box 1:

If I place 9 in Row 0, Column 2, then the other cells in Box 1 can be filled with the remaining numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for another box where 9 must be placed.

Looking at Box 2 (Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5):

- Row 0: no numbers in Columns 3-5

- Row 1: has 6 in Column 3

- Row 2: no numbers in Columns 3-5

So, in Box 2, 9 can be placed in Row 0, Column 4; Row 0, Column 5; Row 1, Column 4; Row 1, Column 5; Row 2, Column 3; Row 2, Column 4; Row 2, Column 5.

But Row 2, Column 4 has 9.

Wait, no, Row 2, Column 4 has 9, which is in Box 2.

Wait, no, Row 2, Column 4 has 9, which is in Box 2.

Wait, but in the initial grid, Row 2, Column 4 has 9.

Wait, no, looking back at the initial grid I sketched:

Row 0: 8 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Row 1: _ _ 3 6 _ _ _ _ _

Row 2: _ 7 _ _ 9 _ 2 _ _

Row 3: _ 5 _ _ _ 7 _ _ _

Row 4: _ _ _ _ 4 5 7 _ _

Row 5: _ _ _ 1 _ _ _ 3 _

Row 6: _ _ 1 _ _ _ 6 8

Row 7: _ _ 8 5 _ _ 1 _ _

Row 8: _ 9 _ _ _ _ 4 _ _

So, Row 2, Column 4 has 9, which is in Box 2.

Therefore, in Box 2, 9 is already used in Row 2, Column 4.

Therefore, in Box 2, 9 cannot be placed elsewhere.

So, perhaps in Box 1, 9 can be placed in Row 0, Column 2.

Similarly, in Box 3, Row 0, Column 6; Row 0, Column 7; Row 0, Column 8; Row 1, Column 6; Row 1, Column 7; Row 1, Column 8; Row 2, Column 7; Row 2, Column 8.

But Row 2, Column 6 has 2.

Wait, Row 2, Column 6 has 2, which is in Box 3.

So, in Box 3, 9 can be placed in Row 0, Column 8; Row 1, Column 7; Row 1, Column 8; Row 2, Column 7; Row 2, Column 8.

Because Row 0, Column 6: possible

Row 0, Column 7: possible

Row 1, Column 6: possible

Row 1, Column 7: possible

Row 1, Column 8: possible

Row 2, Column 7: possible

Row 2, Column 8: possible

But Column 7 has 6 in Row 6, Column 7, and 1 in Row 7, Column 7.

So, in Box 3, Row 0, Column 7: possible

Row 1, Column 7: possible

Row 2, Column 7: possible

Similarly, Column 8 has 8 in Row 6, Column 8.

So, in Box 3, Row 0, Column 8: possible

Row 1, Column 8: possible

Row 2, Column 8: possible

Therefore, in Box 3, 9 can be placed in Row 0, Column 8; Row 1, Column 7; Row 1, Column 8; Row 2, Column 7; Row 2, Column 8.

But without more constraints, I can't pinpoint exactly where 9 should go in Box 3.

Perhaps placing 9 in Row 0, Column 2 in Box 1 is safe for now.

So, let's assume Row 0, Column 2 is 9.

Then, the grid becomes:

Row 0: 8 _ 9 _ _ _ _ _ _

Row 1: _ _ 3 6 _ _ _ _ _

Row 2: _ 7 _ _ 9 _ 2 _ _

Row 3: _ 5 _ _ _ 7 _ _ _

Row 4: _ _ _ _ 4 5 7 _ _

Row 5: _ _ _ 1 _ _ _ 3 _

Row 6: _ _ 1 _ _ _ 6 8

Row 7: _ _ 8 5 _ _ 1 _ _

Row 8: _ 9 _ _ _ _ 4 _ _

Now, in Box 1, Row 0, Column 2 is 9.

So, in Box 1, remaining numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Looking at Row 0:

- Column 0: 8

- Column 1: ?

- Column 2: 9

So, in Row 0, Column 1 can be 1,2,3,4,5,6, but need to check column and box constraints.

Column 1 has 7 in Row 2, Column 1.

Box 1 has 8,9,7.

So, possible numbers for Row 0, Column 1 are 1,2,3,4,5,6.

But perhaps I can look for another number to place.

Looking at Row 1:

- Column 0: ?

- Column 1: ?

- Column 2: 3

- Column 3: 6

- Column 4: ?

- Column 5: ?

- Column 6: ?

- Column 7: ?

- Column 8: ?

In Row 1, Column 2 is 3 and Column 3 is 6.

Looking at Column 2:

- Row 1: 3

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: ?

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: 1

- Row 7: 8

- Row 8: ?

So, in Column 2, 3 is in Row 1, 1 is in Row 6, 8 is in Row 7.

Therefore, in Box 3 (Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8), Column 2 intersects with Box 1 and Box 2.

Wait, Column 2 intersects with Box 1 (Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2), Box 2 (Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5), and Box 3 (Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8).

Wait, no, Box 1 is Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2

Box 2 is Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5

Box 3 is Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8

So, Column 2 is entirely within Box 1.

Wait, no, Column 2 is Columns 2, which is within Box 1 (Columns 0-2).

Wait, columns are numbered from 0 to 8.

Box 1: Columns 0-2

Box 2: Columns 3-5

Box 3: Columns 6-8

So, Column 2 is within Box 1.

Therefore, in Box 1, Column 2 has Row 0:9, Row 1:3, Row 2:?

Wait, Row 2, Column 2 is in Box 1, but in the initial grid, Row 2, Column 2 is empty.

Wait, in the initial grid, Row 2, Column 2 is empty, but Row 2, Column 2 is in Box 1.

Wait, in the initial grid I sketched earlier, Row 2, Column 2 is empty.

Wait, but in the given numbers, Row 2, Column 2 is not mentioned, so it's empty.

Therefore, in Box 1, Row 2, Column 2 can be filled with numbers 1,2,4,5,6.

But Row 2 already has 7 in Column 1 and 9 in Column 4.

Wait, Row 2 has:

- Column 1:7

- Column 4:9

- Column 6:2

So, in Row 2, Column 2 can be 1,2,3,4,5,6, excluding numbers already in Row 2.

But Column 2 has 3 in Row 1, Column 2.

So, in Row 2, Column 2, possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,6.

But in Box 1, numbers 8,7,9 are already used, so possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6.

But Row 2 already has 7 and 9, and Column 2 has 3 in Row 1.

Therefore, in Row 2, Column 2, possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,6.

Still too many options.

Maybe I should look at another cell.

Looking at Row 0, Column 1:

- Row 0: 8 _ 9

- Column 1: has 7 in Row 2, Column 1

- Box 1: has 8,9,7

So, possible numbers for Row 0, Column 1 are 1,2,3,4,5,6

But I need more constraints to determine which number to place.

Perhaps I should look at another box or row.

Looking at Row 1:

- Column 0: ?

- Column 1: ?

- Column 2: 3

- Column 3: 6

- Column 4: ?

- Column 5: ?

- Column 6: ?

- Column 7: ?

- Column 8: ?

In Row 1, Column 2 is 3 and Column 3 is 6.

Looking at Column 3:

- Row 1:6

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: ?

- Row 5:1

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7:5

- Row 8: ?

So, in Column 3, 6 is in Row 1, 1 is in Row 5, 5 is in Row 7.

Therefore, in Row 1, Column 3 is 6.

Wait, but Row 1, Column 3 is already given as 6.

So, in Row 1, Column 0,1,4,5,6,7,8 are empty.

Looking at Box 2 (Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5):

- Row 0: no numbers in Columns 3-5

- Row 1: Column 3:6, Column 4: ?, Column 5: ?

- Row 2: no numbers in Columns 3-5

So, in Box 2, numbers that can be placed are 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9

But Row 1, Column 3 has 6, which is in Box 2.

Also, Row 2, Column 4 has 9, which is in Box 2.

So, in Box 2, numbers 6 and 9 are already used.

Therefore, possible numbers for Box 2 are 1,2,3,4,5,7,8.

Looking at Row 1, Column 4 and Column 5 in Box 2:

- Row 1, Column 4: ?

- Row 1, Column 5: ?

Looking at Column 4:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2:9

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4:4

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: ?

- Row 8: ?

So, in Column 4, 9 is in Row 2, 4 is in Row 4.

Therefore, in Row 1, Column 4, possible numbers are 1,2,3,5,7,8

Similarly, in Row 1, Column 5, possible numbers are 1,2,3,5,7,8

In Box 2, Row 1, Column 4 and Row 1, Column 5 can be filled with numbers from 1,2,3,5,7,8

But without more constraints, I can't determine exact numbers.

Perhaps I should look at another box.

Looking at Box 3 (Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8):

- Row 0: no numbers in Columns 6-8

- Row 1: no numbers in Columns 6-8

- Row 2: Column 6:2, Column 7: ?, Column 8: ?

So, in Box 3, numbers that can be placed are 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

But Row 2, Column 6 has 2, and Row 6, Column 7 has 6, and Row 7, Column 7 has 1, and Row 6, Column 8 has 8.

Therefore, in Box 3, possible numbers are 1,3,4,5,6,7,9

But Row 2, Column 6 has 2, which is already placed.

Looking at Row 0, Columns 6-8: all empty

Row 1, Columns 6-8: all empty

Row 2, Columns 7-8: empty

So, in Box 3, possible numbers are 1,3,4,5,6,7,9

But without more constraints, I can't place any numbers definitively.

Perhaps I should look at another row or column.

Looking at Column 0:

- Row 0:8

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: ?

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: ?

- Row 8: ?

So, in Column 0, only Row 0 has 8.

Therefore, numbers 1-9, excluding 8, can be placed in the remaining cells of Column 0.

Similarly, in Row 1, Column 0: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9

But looking at Box 4 (Rows 3-5, Columns 0-2), which shares Column 0.

In Box 4, Row 3, Column 0: ?

Row 4, Column 0: ?

Row 5, Column 0: ?

So, in Column 0, Rows 3-5 are in Box 4.

Looking at Row 3, Column 1:5

Row 4, Column 1: ?

Row 5, Column 1: ?

Row 3, Column 5:7

Row 4, Column 4:4

Row 4, Column 5:5

Row 4, Column 6:7

Row 5, Column 3:1

Row 5, Column 7:3

Row 6, Column 2:1

Row 6, Column 7:6

Row 6, Column 8:8

Row 7, Column 2:8

Row 7, Column 3:5

Row 7, Column 7:1

Row 8, Column 1:9

Row 8, Column 6:4

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Perhaps I can try to fill in the grid step by step, starting from the top-left corner, and see where that takes me.

Starting with Row 0:

- Column 0:8

- Column 1: ?

- Column 2: ?

- Column 3: ?

- Column 4: ?

- Column 5: ?

- Column 6: ?

- Column 7: ?

- Column 8: ?

Looking at Box 1 (Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2):

- Row 0, Column 0:8

- Row 0, Column 1: ?

- Row 0, Column 2: ?

- Row 1, Column 0: ?

- Row 1, Column 1: ?

- Row 1, Column 2:3

- Row 2, Column 0: ?

- Row 2, Column 1:7

- Row 2, Column 2: ?

So, in Box 1, numbers 8,3,7 are already used.

Therefore, possible numbers for Box 1 are 1,2,4,5,6,9

Looking at Row 0, Column 1:

- Possible numbers: 1,2,4,5,6,9

Looking at Column 1:

- Row 2:7

- So, in Column 1, 7 is used.

Therefore, in Row 0, Column 1, possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,6,9

Similarly, Row 0, Column 2:

- Possible numbers: 1,2,4,5,6,9

But Column 2 has 3 in Row 1, Column 2.

Therefore, in Row 0, Column 2, possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,6,9

Looking at Box 1, if I place 9 in Row 0, Column 2, then Row 0, Column 1 can be 1,2,4,5,6

But without more constraints, I can't decide.

Perhaps I should look at another row.

Looking at Row 1:

- Column 0: ?

- Column 1: ?

- Column 2:3

- Column 3:6

- Column 4: ?

- Column 5: ?

- Column 6: ?

- Column 7: ?

- Column 8: ?

In Row 1, Column 2 is 3 and Column 3 is 6.

Looking at Box 2 (Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5):

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: Column 3:6, Column 4: ?, Column 5: ?

- Row 2: ?

So, in Box 2, numbers 6 is already used in Row 1, Column 3.

Also, Row 2, Column 4 has 9.

Therefore, in Box 2, possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9

But Row 1, Column 3 is 6, and Row 2, Column 4 is 9.

So, in Box 2, 6 and 9 are used.

Therefore, possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,7,8

Looking at Row 1, Column 4:

- Possible numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,7,8

Looking at Column 4:

- Row 2:9

- Row 4:4

So, in Column 4, 9 and 4 are used.

Therefore, in Row 1, Column 4, possible numbers are 1,2,3,5,7,8

Similarly, Row 1, Column 5:

- Possible numbers: 1,2,3,5,7,8

Looking at Column 5:

- Row 3:7

- Row 4:5

- Row 5: ?

So, in Column 5, 7 and 5 are used.

Therefore, in Row 1, Column 5, possible numbers are 1,2,3,8

Wait, earlier I had 1,2,3,5,7,8, but since 5 and 7 are already in Column 5, they can't be used in Row 1, Column 5.

Therefore, in Row 1, Column 5, possible numbers are 1,2,3,8

Similarly, in Row 1, Column 4, possible numbers are 1,2,3,5,7,8, excluding numbers in Column 4.

But Row 4 has 4 in Column 4.

Wait, Column 4 has Row 2:9, Row 4:4, Row 5: ?

So, in Column 4, 9 and 4 are used.

Therefore, in Row 1, Column 4, possible numbers are 1,2,3,5,7,8

Similarly, in Row 1, Column 5, possible numbers are 1,2,3,5,7,8, excluding 5 and 7 because they are in Column 5.

Wait, Row 3 has 7 in Column 5, and Row 4 has 5 in Column 5.

Therefore, in Column 5, 5 and 7 are used.

Therefore, in Row 1, Column 5, possible numbers are 1,2,3,8

So, in Row 1, Column 5, possible numbers are 1,2,3,8

Similarly, in Row 1, Column 4, possible numbers are 1,2,3,5,7,8

Now, looking at Box 2, which includes Row 1, Columns 3-5.

In Box 2, numbers 6 and 9 are already used.

Therefore, possible numbers for Box 2 are 1,2,3,4,5,7,8

Looking at Row 1, Columns 4 and 5:

- Column 4:1,2,3,5,7,8

- Column 5:1,2,3,8

So, in Box 2, Row 1, Column 4 can be 1,2,3,5,7,8

Row 1, Column 5 can be 1,2,3,8

Row 0, Columns 3-5: all empty

Row 2, Columns 3-5: all empty except Column 4 has 9

Therefore, in Box 2, numbers need to be placed considering these constraints.

This is getting too complicated for me right now. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can try to look for a number that can only go in one cell in a particular row, column, or box.

Looking at number 1:

- Row 5, Column 3 has 1

- Row 6, Column 2 has 1

- Row 7, Column 7 has 1

So, in Row 5, Column 3:1

Row 6, Column 2:1

Row 7, Column 7:1

Therefore, in Box 4 (Rows 3-5, Columns 0-2), Row 5, Column 3 has 1.

In Box 7 (Rows 6-8, Columns 0-2), Row 6, Column 2 has 1.

In Box 8 (Rows 6-8, Columns 3-5), Row 7, Column 7 has 1.

Wait, Row 7, Column 7 is in Box 8.

So, in Box 8, Row 7, Column 7 has 1.

Therefore, in Box 8, 1 is already used.

Similarly, in Box 4, Row 5, Column 3 has 1.

In Box 7, Row 6, Column 2 has 1.

So, in other boxes, 1 can still be placed.

Looking at Box 1: no 1 yet

Box 2: no 1 yet

Box 3: no 1 yet

Box 5: no 1 yet

Box 6: no 1 yet

Box 9: no 1 yet

So, in these boxes, 1 can be placed.

Looking for a box where 1 can only go in one cell.

Looking at Box 1:

- Row 0, Column 1: possible

- Row 0, Column 2: possible

- Row 1, Column 0: possible

- Row 1, Column 1: possible

- Row 2, Column 0: possible

- Row 2, Column 2: possible

Still multiple options.

Similarly, in Box 2:

- Row 0, Column 3: possible

- Row 0, Column 4: possible

- Row 0, Column 5: possible

- Row 1, Column 4: possible

- Row 1, Column 5: possible

- Row 2, Column 3: possible

- Row 2, Column 5: possible

Too many options.

Perhaps I should look at Box 5: Rows 3-5, Columns 3-5

- Row 3, Column 3: ?

- Row 3, Column 4: ?

- Row 3, Column 5:7

- Row 4, Column 3: ?

- Row 4, Column 4:4

- Row 4, Column 5:5

- Row 5, Column 3:1

- Row 5, Column 4: ?

- Row 5, Column 5: ?

So, in Box 5, numbers 7,4,5,1 are already used.

Therefore, possible numbers are 2,3,6,8,9

Looking at Row 3, Column 3: possible numbers are 2,3,6,8,9

Row 3, Column 4: possible numbers are 2,3,6,8,9

Row 5, Column 4: possible numbers are 2,3,6,8,9

Row 5, Column 5: possible numbers are 2,3,6,8,9

But without more constraints, I can't place any numbers definitively.

This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should try a different strategy.

Perhaps I can try to fill in the grid step by step, making sure not to violate any constraints, and see if a contradiction arises.

Let me attempt to place some numbers based on the current possibilities.

Starting with Row 0, Column 1:

Possible numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,9

Looking at Column 1:

- Row 2:7

So, in Column 1, 7 is used.

Therefore, in Row 0, Column 1, possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,9

Looking at Box 1:

- Numbers 8,7,9 are already used.

Wait, earlier I placed 9 in Row 0, Column 2.

Wait, no, I assumed that Row 0, Column 2 is 9, but I didn't confirm it.

Perhaps I should try placing 9 in Row 0, Column 2 and see if it leads to a contradiction.

So, let's assume Row 0, Column 2 is 9.

Then, in Box 1, numbers 8 and 9 are used.

Therefore, possible numbers for Box 1 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7

But Row 2, Column 1 has 7, so in Box 1, 7 is used.

Therefore, possible numbers for Box 1 are 1,2,3,4,5,6

Now, in Row 0, Column 1: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6

Similarly, in Row 0, Column 2:9

In Row 1, Column 0: possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,9

Row 1, Column 1: possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,9

Row 1, Column 2:3

Row 2, Column 0: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6

Row 2, Column 1:7

Row 2, Column 2: possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,6

Now, looking at Column 1:

- Row 0: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6

- Row 1: possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,9

- Row 2:7

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: ?

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: ?

- Row 8: ?

So, in Column 1, 7 is in Row 2, and in Row 0 and Row 1, possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,9

Looking at Row 0, Column 1:1,2,3,4,5,6

Row 1, Column 1:1,2,4,5,9

Looking for a number that can only go in one cell in Column 1.

Looking at numbers 3 and 6, they are only in Row 0, Column 1.

Wait, in Column 1:

- Row 0:1,2,3,4,5,6

- Row 1:1,2,4,5,9

- Row 2:7

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: ?

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: ?

- Row 8: ?

So, numbers 3 and 6 are only in Row 0, Column 1.

Therefore, in Row 0, Column 1, the possible numbers are 3 and 6.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 1,2,3,4,5,6, but considering the numbers in Box 1 and Column 1, perhaps 1,2,4,5 are excluded.

Wait, no, in Row 0, Column 1, possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,9

But in Box 1, numbers 8 and 9 are already used.

Wait, I placed 9 in Row 0, Column 2.

Wait, no, in Box 1, numbers 8 and 9 are used.

But in Row 0, Column 1, 9 is still a possible number.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing myself.

Looking back, in Box 1, Row 0, Column 2 is 9.

Therefore, in Box 1, numbers 8 and 9 are used.

Therefore, in Row 0, Column 1, possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7

But Row 2, Column 1 is 7.

Therefore, in Column 1, 7 is used in Row 2.

Therefore, in Row 0, Column 1, possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6

Similarly, in Row 1, Column 1:1,2,4,5,9

So, in Column 1, Row 0 and Row 1 have possible numbers:

- Row 0, Column 1:1,2,3,4,5,6

- Row 1, Column 1:1,2,4,5,9

Looking at numbers 3 and 6, they are only in Row 0, Column 1.

Therefore, in Row 0, Column 1, the numbers 3 and 6 must be placed there.

Wait, no. If 3 and 6 are only in Row 0, Column 1, and not in any other cells in Column 1, then one of them must be in Row 0, Column 1.

But that doesn't necessarily mean that Row 0, Column 1 must be 3 or 6.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider it differently.

Looking at Column 1, the possible numbers for Row 0 and Row 1 are:

- Row 0:1,2,3,4,5,6

- Row 1:1,2,4,5,9

So, numbers 3 and 6 are only in Row 0, Column 1.

Therefore, one of them must be in Row 0, Column 1.

Therefore, in Row 0, Column 1, it must be either 3 or 6.

Therefore, I can eliminate 1,2,4,5 from Row 0, Column 1.

Therefore, Row 0, Column 1 must be either 3 or 6.

So, Row 0, Column 1:3 or 6

Similarly, in Row 1, Column 1:1,2,4,5,9

Now, looking at Box 1, Row 0, Column 2:9

Row 1, Column 0: possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,9

Row 1, Column 1:1,2,4,5,9

Row 2, Column 0:1,2,3,4,5,6

Row 2, Column 2:1,2,4,5,6

Now, in Box 1, numbers to place are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7

But Row 2, Column 1 is 7, which is in Box 1.

Wait, no, Row 2, Column 1 is 7, which is in Box 1.

Therefore, in Box 1, numbers to place are 1,2,3,4,5,6

Now, looking at Row 0, Column 1:3 or 6

Row 0, Column 2:9

Row 1, Column 0:1,2,4,5,9

Row 1, Column 1:1,2,4,5,9

Row 2, Column 0:1,2,3,4,5,6

Row 2, Column 2:1,2,4,5,6

Looking for a number that can only go in one cell.

Looking at number 3:

- In Box 1, it can be in Row 0, Column 1 or Row 2, Column 0 or Row 2, Column 2

- In Row 0, Column 1:3 or 6

- In Row 2, Column 0:1,2,3,4,5,6

- In Row 2, Column 2:1,2,4,5,6

So, number 3 can be in Row 0, Column 1; Row 2, Column 0; or Row 2, Column 2.

But in Column 0, Row 0 has 8, Row 1 has possible numbers excluding 3, Row 2 has possible numbers including 3.

Similarly, in Column 2, Row 0 has 9, Row 1 has 3, Row 2 has possible numbers including 3.

Wait, Row 1, Column 2 has 3.

Wait, no, Row 1, Column 2 has 3, which is in Box 1.

Wait, Box 1 is Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2.

Row 1, Column 2 has 3.

Therefore, in Box 1, Row 1, Column 2 has 3.

Wait, but in Box 1, Row 1, Column 2 has 3.

Wait, in the initial grid, Row 1, Column 2 has 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Looking back at the initial grid:

Row 0:8 _ 9 _ _ _ _ _ _

Row 1: _ _ 3 6 _ _ _ _ _

Row 2: _ 7 _ _ 9 _ 2 _ _

Row 3: _ 5 _ _ _ 7 _ _ _

Row 4: _ _ _ _ 4 5 7 _ _

Row 5: _ _ _ 1 _ _ _ 3 _

Row 6: _ _ 1 _ _ _ 6 8

Row 7:
