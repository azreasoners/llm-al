Here is the solution to the Sudoku puzzle:

7 0 4 | 1 5 8 | 2 6 3
5 1 2 | 3 6 4 | 8 7 0
3 6 8 | 7 2 0 | 1 4 5
-----+-------+------
1 4 5 | 8 7 6 | 0 3 2
8 2 0 | 5 3 1 | 4 6 7
6 7 3 | 0 4 2 | 5 1 8
-----+-------+------
2 0 1 | 6 8 3 | 7 5 4
4 5 7 | 2 0 6 | 3 8 1
0 8 6 | 4 1 5 | 0 2 3

To solve this, I first filled in the given numbers in their specified positions. Then I used the Sudoku solving techniques of scanning rows, columns and 3x3 boxes to identify where each missing number must go based on the constraints that each row, column and 3x3 box must contain the numbers 0-8 exactly once.

For example, in the top-left 3x3 box, 7, 2 and 5 were given. Scanning that box, the missing numbers were 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8. Looking at the top row which already had 7, the only place 0 could go in that 3x3 box was row 0 column 1. Filling that in, and repeatedly using such logical deductions to fill in one number at a time eventually solved the entire puzzle.
