Okay, let's tackle this Sudoku puzzle. First, I need to visualize the given numbers on the 9x9 grid. The user provided specific cells with their values, so I'll start by plotting those onto a Sudoku grid. Let me note down each given cell:

- (0,0) is 8

- (1,2) is 3

- (1,3) is 6

- (2,1) is 7

- (2,4) is 9

- (2,6) is 2

- (3,1) is 5

- (3,5) is 7

- (4,4) is 4

- (4,5) is 5

- (4,6) is 7

- (5,3) is 1

- (5,7) is 3

- (6,2) is 1

- (6,7) is 6

- (6,8) is 8

- (7,2) is 8

- (7,3) is 5

- (7,7) is 1

- (8,1) is 9

- (8,6) is 4

Alright, now I'll sketch this out. Let's start with row 0. Only (0,0) is 8. The rest are empty. In row 1, columns 2 and 3 are 3 and 6. Row 2 has 7 in column 1, 9 in column 4, and 2 in column 6. Row 3 has 5 in column 1 and 7 in column 5. Row 4 has 4,5,7 in columns 4,5,6. Row 5 has 1 in column 3 and 3 in column 7. Row 6 has 1 in column 2, 6 in column 7, and 8 in column 8. Row 7 has 8 in column 2, 5 in column 3, and 1 in column 7. Row 8 has 9 in column 1 and 4 in column 6.

Now, let's begin solving. Sudoku requires each row, column, and 3x3 box to have numbers 1-9 without repetition. Let's go step by step, maybe starting with the most filled rows or columns.

Looking at row 2: columns 1,4,6 are filled. So we have 7,9,2 in those positions. The remaining numbers needed are 1,3,4,5,6,8. Let's check column 0 of row 2. What's in column 0? Let's check the 3x3 box. Row 2 is in the top-middle box (rows 0-2, columns 0-2). The existing numbers in this box are 8 (from row 0, col 0), 3 (row 1, col 2), 7 (row 2, col 1). So in this box, numbers 3,7,8 are present. So for row 2, column 0, possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,6,9. But wait, in the row, we already have 7,9,2. Wait, row 2's existing numbers are 7 (col1), 9 (col4), 2 (col6). Wait, no, those are different columns. Wait, row 2's filled cells are (2,1)=7, (2,4)=9, (2,6)=2. So the row currently has 7,9,2. So the missing numbers are 1,3,4,5,6,8. Now, column 0: looking at column 0, what's already there? Row 0 has 8, row 2's column 0 is empty. Other cells in column 0: rows 3,4,5,6,7,8. Let's check if any of those have numbers. From the given data, I don't see any other numbers in column 0 except row 0's 8. So possible numbers for row 2, column 0 are 1,3,4,5,6 (since 8 is already in the column). But also, the 3x3 box (top-left) which includes rows 0-2, columns 0-2. In this box, we have 8 (0,0), 3 (1,2), 7 (2,1). So missing numbers in the box are 1,2,4,5,6,9. But row 2, column 0 is in this box. So possible numbers here are 1,4,5,6 (since 2 and 9 are already in the row, and 3,7,8 are in the box). Wait, but the row already has 7,9,2. So 2 and 9 are in the row, so they can't be in this cell. The box has 8,3,7. So possible numbers for this cell are 1,4,5,6. But also, column 0 has 8 in row 0, so column 0 can't have 8 again, but we already considered that. So possible numbers for (2,0): 1,4,5,6. Hmm, not enough info yet. Let's check other cells.

Looking at row 8: column 1 is 9 and column 6 is 4. So row 8 needs numbers 1,2,3,5,6,7,8. Let's check column 0 of row 8. Column 0: already has 8 in row 0. So possible numbers are 1-7,9. But row 8 already has 9 in column 1, so 9 is excluded. So possible numbers for (8,0):1,2,3,5,6,7. Also, the 3x3 box for row 8, column 0 is the bottom-left box (rows 6-8, columns 0-2). In this box, existing numbers: (6,2)=1, (7,2)=8, (8,1)=9. So numbers 1,8,9 are present. So possible numbers for (8,0):2,3,4,5,6,7. But column 0 has 8 in row 0, so 8 is excluded. So possible numbers are 2,3,4,5,6,7. Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe check another cell.

Looking at row 6: (6,2)=1, (6,7)=6, (6,8)=8. So row 6 needs numbers 2,3,4,5,7,9. Let's check column 0 of row 6. Column 0: only 8 in row 0. So possible numbers 1-7,9. But row 6 has 1 in column 2, so 1 is possible? Wait, row 6 doesn't have 1 in other columns except column 2. Wait, row 6's existing numbers are 1 (col2),6 (col7),8 (col8). So in column 0, possible numbers are 2,3,4,5,7,9. Also, the 3x3 box (bottom-left) for (6,0) has numbers 1 (6,2),8 (7,2),9 (8,1). So missing numbers in the box: 2,3,4,5,6,7. So (6,0) can be 2,3,4,5,6,7. But column 0 has 8 only. So possible numbers for (6,0):2,3,4,5,6,7. Hmm, not narrowed down yet.

Maybe check for cells that have only one possible option. Let's look at row 5, which has (5,3)=1 and (5,7)=3. So row 5 needs numbers 2,4,5,6,7,8,9. Let's check column 0 of row 5. Column 0 has 8 in row 0. So possible numbers 1-7,9. But row 5 doesn't have those yet. But in the 3x3 box (middle-left, rows 3-5, columns 0-2). Existing numbers: (3,1)=5, (5,3)=1 (but column 3 is outside this box). Wait, the box is rows 3-5, columns 0-2. So existing numbers in this box: (3,1)=5, (5,3) is in a different box. Are there any other numbers? Let's check the given data again. Maybe (4,4)=4 is in another box. So in this middle-left box, only (3,1)=5 is given. So possible numbers for (5,0) would be 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9, except row 5 can't have duplicates. Wait, row 5 has 1 and 3 already. Wait, (5,3)=1 and (5,7)=3. So in row 5, numbers 1 and 3 are present. So possible numbers for (5,0):2,4,5,6,7,8,9. But column 0 has 8 in row 0, so 8 is possible here unless it's in the box. The box (middle-left) has (3,1)=5. So possible numbers here could include 8. Hmm, not helpful. Maybe another cell.

Looking at row 7: (7,2)=8, (7,3)=5, (7,7)=1. So row 7 needs numbers 2,3,4,6,7,9. Let's check column 0 of row 7. Column 0 has 8 in row 0. So possible numbers:1-7,9. But row 7 has 8,5,1. So possible numbers:2,3,4,6,7,9. The 3x3 box (bottom-middle, rows 6-8, columns 3-5). Wait, row 7, column 0 is in the bottom-left box (rows 6-8, cols 0-2). In that box: (6,2)=1, (7,2)=8, (8,1)=9. So possible numbers for (7,0):2,3,4,5,6,7. Because the box has 1,8,9. Column 0 has 8. So (7,0) can be 2,3,4,5,6,7. But row 7 already has 5 in column 3, so 5 is allowed here. Hmm, not narrowing down.

Maybe check a column with several numbers. Let's look at column 0. It has 8 in row 0. The rest are empty. So missing numbers in column 0:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9. Let's check each row's column 0 for possibilities.

Row 0, column 0 is 8.

Row 1, column 0: possible numbers 1-7,9 (since column 0 has 8). Also, row 1 has 3 and 6 in columns 2 and 3. So row 1 needs 1,2,4,5,7,8,9. But column 0 can't be 8. So possible numbers:1,2,4,5,7,9. Also, the 3x3 box (top-left, rows 0-2, cols 0-2). Existing numbers:8 (0,0), 3 (1,2), 7 (2,1). So missing numbers:1,2,4,5,6,9. So for (1,0), possible numbers are the intersection of row 1's needs (1,2,4,5,7,9), column 0's needs (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9), and box's needs (1,2,4,5,6,9). So intersection is 1,2,4,5,9. So possible numbers:1,2,4,5,9. Hmm, still too many.

Alternatively, let's look for cells where a number can only go in one place. For example, in a row, if a number can only fit in one cell.

Take row 0: only (0,0)=8. So missing numbers are 1-7,9. Let's check each column in row 0.

Column 1 of row 0: possible numbers? Column 1 has (2,1)=7, (3,1)=5, (8,1)=9. So column 1 has 5,7,9. So possible numbers for row 0, column 1:1,2,3,4,6,8. But row 0 has 8 already, so 8 is excluded. So possible numbers:1,2,3,4,6. Also, the top-left box (rows 0-2, cols 0-2) has 8,3,7. So missing numbers:1,2,4,5,6,9. So for (0,1), possible numbers are intersection of column 1's allowed (1,2,3,4,6) and box's allowed (1,2,4,5,6,9). So intersection is 1,2,4,6. So possible numbers:1,2,4,6. Hmm.

Similarly, column 2 in row 0: column 2 has (1,2)=3, (2,6)=2 (but that's column 6), (6,2)=1, (7,2)=8. Wait, column 2 has (1,2)=3, (6,2)=1, (7,2)=8. So column 2 has 1,3,8. So possible numbers for row 0, column 2:2,4,5,6,7,9. Also, the top-left box has existing numbers 8,3,7 (from (0,0), (1,2), (2,1)). So missing in box:1,2,4,5,6,9. So (0,2) is in this box. So possible numbers:2,4,5,6,9. Intersection with column 2's allowed (2,4,5,6,7,9) gives 2,4,5,6,9. So possible for (0,2):2,4,5,6,9.

This isn't narrowing it down enough. Maybe look for numbers that are missing in a 3x3 box and see if they can only go in one cell.

Take the top-left box (rows 0-2, cols 0-2). Missing numbers:1,2,4,5,6,9. Let's check each cell in this box.

(0,0)=8, (0,1)=?, (0,2)=?

(1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=3

(2,0)=?, (2,1)=7, (2,2)=?

Looking for where a missing number can only fit in one cell.

Take number 1: is there a cell in the top-left box where 1 must go?

Check row 0: column 0-2. Column 0 has row 6,7,8's column 0 empty, but in column 0, row 0 is 8, others are empty. But in column 1, row 0's column 1: column 1 has 7,5,9 in rows 2,3,8. So 1 is not present in column 1. So row 0, column 1 could have 1. But also, in row 0, column 2 could have 1. Wait, column 2 has 3,1,8 in rows 1,6,7. So 1 is already in column 2 (row 6). So row 0, column 2 can't be 1. Therefore, in the top-left box, the only place for 1 could be row 0, column 1 or row 1, column 0 or row 2, column 0 or row 2, column 2.

But let's check if 1 is present in any other row in this box. Row 0: no 1. Row 1: no 1. Row 2: no 1. So 1 could be in any of the empty cells. Not helpful.

How about number 9? In the top-left box, missing numbers include 9. Where can 9 be placed?

Row 0: columns 0-2. Column 0 has 8. Column 1: no 9 yet. Column 2: no 9. But row 0 can't have 9 in column 1 or 2 if other constraints allow. Let's check columns. Column 1 has 7,5,9 (rows 2,3,8). Wait, column 1 has 7 (row2),5 (row3),9 (row8). So column 1 already has 9 in row8. Therefore, 9 cannot be in column 1 of any other row. So in the top-left box, column 1 is rows 0-2, column 1. But column 1 has 7 (row2),5 (row3),9 (row8). Wait, row3 is outside the top-left box. Wait, the top-left box is rows 0-2, columns 0-2. So column 1 in the top-left box is rows 0-2, column1. In column1, rows 0-2: row2, column1 is 7. Rows 0 and 1, column1 are empty. But in the entire column1 (all rows), there's 7 (row2),5 (row3),9 (row8). So in the top-left box's column1 (rows0-2), the existing number is 7 (row2). So 9 is not present here, so 9 can be in column1 of rows0 or1. But in the entire column1, row8 has 9, so rows0 and1 can't have 9 in column1. Wait, no, column1 in the entire Sudoku has 7 (row2),5 (row3),9 (row8). Therefore, in the top-left box's column1 (rows0-2), the only number is 7 in row2. So 9 cannot be placed in column1 of the top-left box because column1 (all rows) already has 9 in row8. Therefore, in the top-left box, 9 can't be in column1. Therefore, possible positions for 9 are (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2).

But let's check row0: can it have 9? Row0 has 8. So 9 is possible in row0. Column2 of row0: column2 has 3 (row1),1 (row6),8 (row7). So column2 doesn't have 9. So (0,2) could be 9. Also, check the box. If (0,2) is 9, does that conflict? Let's see. If we put 9 in (0,2), then column2 gets 9, which is okay. But let's check if there's another constraint. Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, let's look at row2. Row2 has 7 (col1),9 (col4),2 (col6). So missing numbers in row2 are 1,3,4,5,6,8. Let's see if any of these can be placed uniquely.

Looking at column0 of row2. Possible numbers:1,4,5,6 (from earlier analysis). But maybe there's a number that can't go elsewhere in the row. Let's check number 8 in row2. Row2 needs 8. Where can 8 go? Columns0,2,3,5,7,8. Column0: possible numbers are 1,4,5,6 (as column0 has 8 in row0). So 8 can't go here. Column2: row2, column2. Column2 has 3 (row1),1 (row6),8 (row7). So column2 has 8 in row7, so row2, column2 can't be 8. Column3: row2, column3. Column3 has 6 (row1),5 (row7). So column3 has 6 and5. So row2, column3 can be 1,2,3,4,7,8,9. But row2 needs 8, but column3 can't have 8 if it's allowed. Wait, column3 has no 8 yet. So row2, column3 could be 8. Let's check if that's possible. If we put 8 in (2,3), then column3 would have 6 (row1),8 (row2),5 (row7), which is okay. Also, the 3x3 box for (2,3) is top-middle box (rows0-2, cols3-5). Existing numbers in this box: row1, col3=6, row2, col4=9. So missing numbers in this box are 1,2,3,4,5,7,8. Putting 8 in (2,3) would be okay. But does that conflict with any other constraints? Let's see. Row2 would then have 8 in column3, which is allowed. However, in the top-middle box, there's also row0 and row1's columns3-5. Row0's columns3-5 are empty. Row1's column3=6, col4=?, col5=?. Hmm. Wait, the top-middle box (rows0-2, cols3-5) includes (2,4)=9. So if we place 8 in (2,3), then the box would have 6 (row1,3),9 (row2,4), and 8 (row2,3). That's okay. But does this help us? Maybe not immediately.

Alternatively, let's check if 8 can be placed elsewhere in row2. Column5: row2, column5. Column5 has 7 (row3),5 (row4). So column5 can have 8. So (2,5) could be 8. Let's see if that's possible. If (2,5)=8, then row2 has 8, column5 has 8. Also, the top-middle box (rows0-2, cols3-5) would have 8 in (2,5). That's okay. But we need to check if there's a conflict. Hmm. Not sure. This approach might not be the best.

Maybe switch to looking at the 3x3 boxes with more filled numbers. For example, the center box (rows3-5, cols3-5). Let's see what's there. Given numbers:

Row3: (3,5)=7

Row4: (4,4)=4, (4,5)=5, (4,6)=7 (but column6 is outside this box)

Row5: (5,3)=1

So in the center box (rows3-5, cols3-5), we have:

(3,5)=7

(4,4)=4, (4,5)=5

(5,3)=1

So missing numbers:2,3,6,8,9.

Let's check each cell in this box.

Row3, col3: (3,3) is empty. Row3 has (3,1)=5, (3,5)=7. So row3 needs numbers 1,2,3,4,6,8,9. But 1 is in row5, col3. Wait, row3 can't have 1 again. Wait, row3's existing numbers:5,7. So possible numbers for (3,3):2,3,4,6,8,9. Column3: (1,3)=6, (5,3)=1, (7,3)=5. So column3 has 6,1,5. So (3,3) can't be 6,1,5. So possible numbers:2,3,4,8,9. Also, the center box needs 2,3,6,8,9. So possible numbers for (3,3):2,3,8,9 (since 4 is not in the center box's missing numbers). Wait, no: the center box's missing numbers are 2,3,6,8,9. So (3,3) can be 2,3,6,8,9. But column3 excludes 6 (from row1), so (3,3) can be 2,3,8,9. Hmm.

Looking at row3, col4: (3,4) is empty. Row3 needs numbers 2,3,4,6,8,9. Column4 has (2,4)=9, (4,4)=4. So column4 has 9 and4. So possible numbers for (3,4):1,2,3,5,6,7,8. But row3 needs 2,3,4,6,8,9, but 4 and9 are excluded because column4 has them. So possible numbers:2,3,6,8. Also, the center box needs 2,3,6,8,9. So possible for (3,4):2,3,6,8. Not helpful.

Row4, col3: (4,3) is empty. Row4 has (4,4)=4, (4,5)=5, (4,6)=7. So row4 needs 1,2,3,6,8,9. Column3 has 6,1,5 in rows1,5,7. So column3 can have 2,3,4,7,8,9. But row4 needs 1,2,3,6,8,9. So possible numbers for (4,3):2,3,6,8,9. Also, center box needs 2,3,6,8,9. So possible numbers here:2,3,6,8,9. Not narrowed down.

Row4, col3: Maybe check if any number can only go here. For example, number 6: in the center box, where can 6 go? Let's see. (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (5,3)=1, (5,4), (5,5). Column3 has 6 in row1, so column3 can't have another 6. Therefore, in the center box, 6 can't be in column3 (rows3-5, col3). So 6 must be in row3 or row4 or row5, but column4 or5. Let's check:

In row3, column4 or5: row3's column5 is already 7. So column4 of row3 could be 6. Let's see if possible. Column4 has 9 (row2),4 (row4). So column4 can have 6. So (3,4) could be 6. Let's check if that's possible. If (3,4)=6, then row3 would have 6, column4 has 6, and the center box has 6. Also, the row3's existing numbers are 5,7,6. That's okay. Does that conflict with anything? Let me see. If (3,4)=6, then in the center box, we've placed 6. Now, check the rest of the box. But maybe there's a reason 6 can't be here. Alternatively, check if 6 is required elsewhere.

Alternatively, look at column5. Column5 has 7 (row3),5 (row4), and possibly others. Let's see, given data: (3,5)=7, (4,5)=5, (5,5)=? Other rows: row0-2, column5: (2,5) is empty. row6-8, column5: (6,5)=?, (7,5)=?, (8,5)=?. So column5 has 7 and5. So missing numbers:1,2,3,4,6,8,9.

If we consider the center box's column5 (rows3-5, col5): (3,5)=7, (4,5)=5. So missing in this part:1,2,3,4,6,8,9. So (5,5) could be one of these. But not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe try a different approach. Let's look for numbers that can only go in one cell within a row, column, or box.

Take number 9 in row8. Row8 has (8,1)=9 and (8,6)=4. So missing numbers in row8:1,2,3,5,6,7,8. Let's check column8 of row8. Column8 has 8 in row6. So (8,8) can't be 8. Possible numbers:1,2,3,5,6,7. Also, the 3x3 box for (8,8) is bottom-right (rows6-8, cols6-8). Existing numbers: (6,7)=6, (6,8)=8, (8,6)=4. So missing numbers:1,2,3,5,7,9. So (8,8) can be 1,2,3,5,7. Intersection with row8's needs (1,2,3,5,6,7,8) and column8's allowed (1,2,3,5,7). So possible numbers:1,2,3,5,7. Hmm. Not helpful.

Alternatively, check if any cell in a box has only one possible number. For example, let's look at the bottom-right box (rows6-8, cols6-8). Existing numbers: (6,7)=6, (6,8)=8, (8,6)=4. Missing numbers:1,2,3,5,7,9. Let's check each cell:

(6,6): row6, col6. Row6 has numbers 1,6,8. Col6 has (2,6)=2, (4,6)=7, (8,6)=4. So (6,6) can't be 2,4,7,1,6,8. So possible numbers:3,5,9. But the box needs 1,2,3,5,7,9. Wait, (6,6) is in row6 and col6. Row6 has 1,6,8. Col6 has 2,7,4. So possible numbers for (6,6):3,5,9. Also, the box needs 3,5,9. So possible numbers:3,5,9. Let's check if any of these can be placed uniquely.

If we look at the box, maybe number 9 can only go here. Let's check other cells in the box:

(7,6): row7, col6. Row7 has 8,5,1. Col6 has 2,7,4. So possible numbers:3,6,9. Box needs 1,2,3,5,7,9. So 3,9. But row7 can't have 9 if it's missing. Wait, row7 needs 2,3,4,6,7,9. So 3 and9 are possible here.

(7,7)=1, so row7, col7 is 1. (7,8): row7, col8. Col8 has 8 in row6. So possible numbers:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9. But row7 needs 2,3,4,6,7,9. So possible numbers:2,3,4,6,7,9. Box needs 1,2,3,5,7,9. So (7,8) can be 2,3,7,9.

(8,7): row8, col7. Col7 has 3 (row5),6 (row6),1 (row7). So possible numbers:2,4,5,7,8,9. Row8 needs 1,2,3,5,6,7,8. So possible numbers:2,5,7,8. Box needs 1,2,3,5,7,9. So intersection:2,5,7.

(8,8): discussed earlier.

Looking for number 9 in the bottom-right box. Can 9 be placed in (6,6)? If yes, then check row6 and column6. Row6 can have 9 (it's missing). Column6 has 2,7,4, so 9 is allowed. So (6,6)=9 is possible. Are there other places for 9 in this box? (7,6) could be 9, but row7 needs 9. (8,8) could be 9, but column8 has 8, and row8 can have 9. Wait, row8 already has 9 in column1. Wait, row8 has (8,1)=9, so row8 can't have another 9. Therefore, in the bottom-right box, 9 cannot be in row8. Therefore, 9 must be in row6 or7. So (6,6)=9 or (7,6)=9 or (7,8)=9.

But row7 can have 9. Let's check column6: (6,6) is column6, which has 2,7,4. So 9 is allowed here. If (6,6)=9, then the box has 9. Let's tentatively place 9 there. Then, row6 would have 9 in column6. Now, row6's missing numbers:2,3,4,5,7. Let's check column6 of row6 is now 9. Wait, no: (6,6)=9, so row6 now has 1 (col2),6 (col7),8 (col8),9 (col6). So missing numbers:2,3,4,5,7. Let's see if this helps. For example, in row6, column0: possible numbers 2,3,4,5,7. If we can find a number that can only go there, but not sure.

Alternatively, placing 9 in (6,6) might help. Let's try that and see if it leads to a contradiction. Assume (6,6)=9. Then, the bottom-right box has 9. Now, looking at row6, column6 is 9. Let's see if this affects other cells.

In row6, missing numbers:2,3,4,5,7. Column0 of row6: possible numbers 2,3,4,5,7 (from earlier). Maybe we can find another number in row6.

Looking at column5 of row6: (6,5). Column5 has 7 (row3),5 (row4). So possible numbers:1,2,3,4,6,8,9. But row6 needs 2,3,4,5,7. So intersection:2,3,4. So (6,5) could be 2,3,4. Let's check the 3x3 box for (6,5), which is middle-right box (rows3-5, cols3-5). Wait, no, row6 is in the bottom row of boxes. (6,5) is in the bottom-middle box (rows6-8, cols3-5). Existing numbers in this box: (6,2)=1 (but that's col2), (7,3)=5, (8,6)=4 (outside this box). So this box (rows6-8, cols3-5) has (7,3)=5. Missing numbers:1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. Not helpful.

Alternatively, check if placing 9 in (6,6) allows us to place another number. For example, in column6, which now has 9, so other cells in column6 can't be 9. But column6 had 2,7,4,9. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's look back to row0, column2. Possible numbers:2,4,5,6,9. If we assume (0,2)=9, then column2 has 9, which is allowed (since column2 has 3,1,8, and now 9). The top-left box would then have 9, which is good. Let's see if that's possible. If (0,2)=9, then row0 has 8 and9. Then, row0's missing numbers:1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Now, check column2 of row0:9. Let's see if that affects other cells.

In the top-middle box (rows0-2, cols3-5), we have (1,3)=6, (2,4)=9. If (0,2)=9, does that affect anything? Not directly. But maybe in row0, we can look for other numbers.

Alternatively, maybe another number in row0. For example, row0, column1. Possible numbers:1,2,4,5,9 (from earlier). If we placed 9 in (0,2), then (0,1) can't be 9. But maybe another number.

This approach is taking too long. Maybe I should look for cells with only one possible number. Let's check row4, which has (4,4)=4, (4,5)=5, (4,6)=7. So missing numbers:1,2,3,6,8,9. Let's look at column7 of row4. Column7 has 3 (row5),6 (row6),1 (row7). So possible numbers for (4,7):2,4,5,7,8,9. But row4 needs 1,2,3,6,8,9. So intersection:2,8,9. Also, the 3x3 box for (4,7) is middle-right box (rows3-5, cols6-8). Existing numbers: (4,6)=7, (5,7)=3. So missing numbers:1,2,4,5,6,8,9. So possible numbers for (4,7):2,8,9 (from row) and 2,8,9 are in the box. So possible:2,8,9. Let's see if any of these can be excluded.

Looking at column7: already has 3,6,1. So 2,8,9 are allowed. Let's check the box. If (4,7)=2, is that possible? Then row4 has 2, which is needed. If (4,7)=8, row4 gets 8. If 9, row4 gets 9. Let's see if any of these numbers are restricted elsewhere.

Looking at row4, column0: possible numbers? Column0 has 8. Row4 needs 1,2,3,6,8,9. So (4,0) can be 1,2,3,6,9. The 3x3 box for (4,0) is middle-left (rows3-5, cols0-2). Existing numbers: (3,1)=5, (4,0) is empty. So possible numbers:1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. Intersection with row4's needs:1,2,3,6,9. So possible numbers:1,2,3,6,9. Not helpful.

Back to (4,7). Let's see if any other cell in row4 can help. For example, (4,8). Column8 has 8 (row6). So possible numbers:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9. Row4 needs 1,2,3,6,8,9. So possible:1,2,3,6,9. The box (middle-right) has (4,6)=7, (5,7)=3. So possible numbers for (4,8):1,2,4,5,6,8,9. Intersection with row4:1,2,6,9. So (4,8) can be 1,2,6,9.

Not helpful. Maybe another cell.

Looking at row7, which has (7,2)=8, (7,3)=5, (7,7)=1. Missing numbers:2,3,4,6,7,9. Let's check column4 of row7. Column4 has (2,4)=9, (4,4)=4. So column4 has 9 and4. So possible numbers for (7,4):1,2,3,5,6,7,8. But row7 needs 2,3,4,6,7,9. So possible numbers:2,3,6,7. Also, the 3x3 box (bottom-middle, rows6-8, cols3-5). Existing numbers: (7,3)=5, (8,6)=4 (outside the box). So missing numbers:1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. So possible for (7,4):2,3,6,7. Let's see if any of these are excluded.

If we consider the column4 (has 9,4), and row7's needs, maybe 6 is possible. Let's check if 6 can be placed in (7,4). Then, column4 has 6, which is okay. The box would have 6. Also, row7 would have 6. Let's see if this leads to a contradiction. If (7,4)=6, then row7 has 6. Now, check the box (bottom-middle). Does this affect other cells? Maybe not immediately. But perhaps this helps in another way.

Alternatively, check if 6 is needed elsewhere. For example, in column4, which now has 9,4,6 (if we place 6 here). But column4 originally had 9 and4. Adding 6 would be okay.

This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I need to use a more systematic approach. Let's pick a cell that has the fewest possibilities and make a guess, then see if it leads to a contradiction.

For example, let's look at (0,1). Possible numbers:1,2,4,5,9 (from earlier analysis). Let's try placing 1 here. If (0,1)=1, then row0 has 1 and8. Column1 has 1, which is okay. The top-left box now has 1. Let's see how this affects other cells.

In the top-left box, missing numbers are now 2,4,5,6,9. Let's look at (0,2). Possible numbers:2,4,5,6,9. But column2 has 3,1,8. So 1 is already in column2 (row6), but (0,2) is in row0. So possible numbers remain 2,4,5,6,9.

If we proceed, this could take forever. Maybe I should look for hidden singles. A hidden single is when a number can only go in one cell within a row, column, or box.

Take the top-middle box (rows0-2, cols3-5). Existing numbers: (1,3)=6, (2,4)=9. Missing numbers:1,2,3,4,5,7,8. Let's check if any number can only go in one cell.

Number 8: check if 8 can only go in one cell in this box. The cells are rows0-2, cols3-5.

Row0, cols3-5: possible numbers. Row0 needs 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9 (since (0,0)=8, (0,1)=1 assumed earlier). Wait, if we placed (0,1)=1, then row0's missing numbers are 2,3,4,5,6,7,9. In the top-middle box (cols3-5), possible numbers for row0: any of the missing numbers except those in the column. For example, (0,3): column3 has 6 (row1),5 (row7). So possible numbers:1,2,3,4,7,8,9. But row0 can't have 1 (if we placed it in (0,1)). Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

I think I need to switch tactics. Let's try to fill in the Sudoku step by step, starting with the given numbers and applying Sudoku rules systematically.

Starting Grid:

Row 0: [8, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _]

Row 1: [_, _, 3, 6, _, _, _, _, _]

Row 2: [_, 7, _, _, 9, _, 2, _, _]

Row 3: [_, 5, _, _, _, 7, _, _, _]

Row 4: [_, _, _, _, 4, 5, 7, _, _]

Row 5: [_, _, _, 1, _, _, _, 3, _]

Row 6: [_, _, 1, _, _, _, _, 6, 8]

Row 7: [_, _, 8, 5, _, _, _, 1, _]

Row 8: [_, 9, _, _, _, _, 4, _, _]

Let me fill this in a grid format for clarity:

0: 8 . . | . . . | . . .

1: . . 3 | 6 . . | . . .

2: . 7 . | . 9 . | 2 . .

---------

3: . 5 . | . . 7 | . . .

4: . . . | . 4 5 | 7 . .

5: . . . | 1 . . | . 3 .

---------

6: . . 1 | . . . | . 6 8

7: . . 8 | 5 . . | . 1 .

8: . 9 . | . . . | 4 . .

Now, let's look for cells that can be filled using elimination.

Starting with row 6: has 1,6,8. Missing numbers:2,3,4,5,7,9. Let's look at column0 of row6. Column0 has 8 in row0. So possible numbers:1,2,3,4,5,7,9. But row6 has 1, so exclude 1. So possible:2,3,4,5,7,9. Also, the bottom-left box (rows6-8, cols0-2) has numbers 1 (6,2),8 (7,2),9 (8,1). So missing:2,3,4,5,6,7. So possible for (6,0):2,3,4,5,7. Now, check if any of these numbers are excluded by column0. Column0: only 8 in row0. So possible:2,3,4,5,7. Now, check row6 for these numbers. Row6 needs 2,3,4,5,7,9. So (6,0) can be 2,3,4,5,7. Not helpful yet.

Looking at column8. Column8 has 8 in row6. So missing numbers:1,2,3,4,5,7,9. Let's check each row in column8:

Row0: (0,8) possible numbers:1-7,9. But row0 has 8. So 1-7,9.

Row1: (1,8) possible:1-9 except row1's existing numbers (3,6). But column8 allows anything except 8.

Wait, focusing on column8, which has 8 in row6. So all other rows in column8 can have 1-7,9.

Looking for a number that can only go in one cell in column8. For example, number 9. Check if 9 can be placed in any row of column8.

Row8, column8: row8 has 9 in column1, so 9 can't be here. Row7, column8: row7 has 8,5,1. So 9 is possible. Row5, column8: row5 has 1,3. So 9 is possible. Row4, column8: row4 has 4,5,7. So 9 is possible. Row3, column8: row3 has 5,7. So 9 is possible. Row2, column8: row2 has 7,9,2. So 9 is already in row2. Row0, column8: row0 has 8. So 9 is possible. So multiple options for 9 in column8. Not helpful.

Let's try looking at row3: missing numbers (excluding 5 and7):1,2,3,4,6,8,9. Column0 of row3: possible numbers 1-7,9 (since column0 has 8). So possible:1,2,3,4,6,9. The 3x3 box (middle-left, rows3-5, cols0-2) has (3,1)=5. So missing numbers:1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. So possible for (3,0):1,2,3,4,6,9. But row3 needs 1,2,3,4,6,8,9. So possible:1,2,3,4,6,9. Not helpful.

Looking at row7: missing numbers 2,3,4,6,7,9. Let's check column5 of row7. Column5 has 7 (row3),5 (row4). So possible numbers:1,2,3,4,6,8,9. Row7 needs 2,3,4,6,7,9. So intersection:2,3,4,6,9. The 3x3 box (bottom-middle, rows6-8, cols3-5) has (7,3)=5, (8,6)=4 (outside the box). So possible numbers for (7,5):2,3,4,6,9. Let's see if any of these can be placed uniquely.

If we consider number 9: can it be in (7,5)? Then column5 would have 9, which is okay. But row7 can have 9. Alternatively, number 6: if (7,5)=6, then column5 has 6, which is okay. Let's check if 6 is needed elsewhere in the box. Not sure. This is not helpful.

Maybe I should look for pairs or triples in rows, columns, or boxes. For example, in row4, which has 4,5,7 in columns4,5,6. Missing numbers:1,2,3,6,8,9. Let's see if any of these can be placed based on their columns.

Looking at (4,0): column0 has 8. Possible numbers:1,2,3,6,9. The box (middle-left) has (3,1)=5. So possible numbers:1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. But row4's needs:1,2,3,6,8,9. So possible:1,2,3,6,9. Not helpful.

This is taking too long. Maybe I need to use a different strategy. Let's focus on the 3x3 boxes and see if any have a number that can only be placed in one cell.

Take the top-right box (rows0-2, cols6-8). Existing numbers: (2,6)=2. Missing numbers:1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Let's check each cell:

(0,6), (0,7), (0,8)

(1,6), (1,7), (1,8)

(2,6)=2, (2,7), (2,8)

Looking for a number that can only go in one cell. For example, number 8. Check if 8 can be placed anywhere in this box.

Column6: (2,6)=2, (4,6)=7, (8,6)=4. So column6 has 2,7,4. So 8 can be in column6. In the top-right box, column6 is rows0-2. So (0,6), (1,6), (2,6). (2,6) is 2. So possible cells: (0,6), (1,6). Let's check if 8 can go here.

Row0, (0,6): row0 has 8 in column0, so 8 can't be here. Therefore, (0,6) can't be 8.

Row1, (1,6): row1 has 3 and6. So 8 is possible here. Column6 allows it. So (1,6)=8 is a possibility. Let's check the box: top-right box would then have 8. Is there any reason this can't be? Let's see. If (1,6)=8, then row1 has 8. Column6 has 8. That's okay. Now, does this help us?

If (1,6)=8, then row1's missing numbers are 1,2,4,5,7,9. Now, looking at column7 for row1. Column7 has 3 (row5),6 (row6),1 (row7). So possible numbers:2,4,5,7,8,9. But row1 needs 1,2,4,5,7,9. So (1,7) can be 2,4,5,7,9. Not helpful.

But if we place 8 in (1,6), then let's see what happens in the top-right box. Missing numbers now:1,3,4,5,6,7,9. Still many possibilities.

Alternatively, check for number 9 in the top-right box. Can 9 be placed in (0,8)? Column8 has 8 in row6. So 9 is allowed. Row0 can have 9. Let's try (0,8)=9. Then row0 has 8,9. Now, missing numbers in row0:1,2,3,4,5,6,7. The top-right box now has 9. Does this help?

In the top-right box, missing numbers:1,3,4,5,6,7,8. If (0,8)=9, then 9 is placed. Now, check other numbers. Not sure.

This is very time-consuming. I think I need to look up the solution or use a more efficient method, but since I'm doing this manually, let's try to find a cell that can only take one number.

Looking at row5: has 1 in col3 and 3 in col7. Missing numbers:2,4,5,6,7,8,9. Let's check column6 of row5. Column6 has 2 (row2),7 (row4),4 (row8). So possible numbers:1,3,5,6,8,9. But row5 needs 2,4,5,6,7,8,9. So intersection:5,6,8,9. The 3x3 box for (5,6) is middle-right (rows3-5, cols6-8). Existing numbers: (4,6)=7, (5,7)=3. So missing numbers:1,2,4,5,6,8,9. So possible for (5,6):5,6,8,9. Not helpful.

Looking at row5, column4: (5,4). Column4 has 9 (row2),4 (row4). So possible numbers:1,2,3,5,6,7,8. Row5 needs 2,4,5,6,7,8,9. So intersection:2,5,6,7,8. Also, the 3x3 box (middle-center, rows3-5, cols3-5) has (3,5)=7, (4,4)=4, (4,5)=5. Missing numbers:1,2,3,6,8,9. So possible for (5,4):2,6,8. Let's see if any of these are possible.

If (5,4)=2, then row5 has 2. Column4 has 2. Is that allowed? Yes. If (5,4)=6, allowed. (5,4)=8, allowed. Not helpful.

Another approach: Let's check for numbers that appear only once in a row, column, or box. For example, number 6 in row7. Row7 has 8,5,1. Missing numbers:2,3,4,6,7,9. Let's see if 6 can only go in one cell in row7.

Column0 of row7: possible numbers:1-7,9. But row7 needs 2,3,4,6,7,9. So possible:2,3,4,6,7,9. The box (bottom-left) has 1,8,9. So possible numbers:2,3,4,5,6,7. So intersection:2,3,4,6,7. So (7,0) can be 2,3,4,6,7. Not helpful.

Column1 of row7: column1 has 7 (row2),5 (row3),9 (row8). So possible numbers:1,2,3,4,6,8. Row7 needs 2,3,4,6. So (7,1) can be 2,3,4,6. The box (bottom-left) has 1,8,9. So possible numbers:2,3,4,5,6,7. Intersection:2,3,4,6. So (7,1) can be 2,3,4,6.

Column4 of row7: discussed earlier.

Column5 of row7: possible numbers:2,3,4,6,9.

Column6 of row7: column6 has 2,7,4. So possible numbers:1,3,5,6,8,9. Row7 needs 6, so (7,6)=6 is possible. Let's check if that's allowed. If (7,6)=6, then column6 has 6, which is okay. The box (bottom-right) would have 6. Let's try this.

If (7,6)=6, then row7 has 6. Now, check the bottom-right box (rows6-8, cols6-8). It has 6 in (7,6), 4 in (8,6), 6 in (6,7),8 in (6,8). So missing numbers:1,2,3,5,7,9. Now, in this box, (7,6)=6, which was placed. Now, row7 has 6, so missing numbers in row7:2,3,4,7,9. Let's check if this helps.

In column6, we have 6 now. Let's look at row8, column6 is 4. So column6 has 2,7,4,6. So possible numbers remaining:1,3,5,8,9. But row8's column6 is already 4.

This still doesn't solve it. I think I need to concede that manually solving this without notes is too time-consuming. However, I recall that Sudoku solutions often require advanced techniques like X-Wing or Swordfish, but since this is a standard puzzle, it should be solvable with basic methods.

Let me try one last approach. Look at cell (0,3). Column3 has 6 (row1),1 (row5),5 (row7). So possible numbers:2,3,4,7,8,9. Row0 needs 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9. So possible numbers for (0,3):2,3,4,7,9. The top-middle box (rows0-2, cols3-5) missing numbers:1,2,3,4,5,7,8. So possible:2,3,4,7. So (0,3) can be 2,3,4,7. Not helpful.

Wait, row0 can't have 1 in column3 because column3 has 1 in row5. So (0,3) can't be 1. But row0 needs 1 somewhere. Let's check where 1 can go in row0.

Row0 needs 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9. Possible columns:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Column1: has 7 (row2),5 (row3),9 (row8). So 1 can be in column1. So (0,1)=1 is possible. Let's tentatively place 1 there.

If (0,1)=1, then row0 has 8 and1. Column1 has 1, which is okay. Now, the top-left box has 1,3,7,8. Missing numbers:2,4,5,6,9.

Now, look at row0's missing numbers:2,3,4,5,6,7,9. Let's check column2 of row0. Column2 has 3 (row1),1 (row6),8 (row7). So possible numbers:2,4,5,6,7,9. The top-left box missing numbers:2,4,5,6,9. So possible for (0,2):2,4,5,6,9.

If we place 9 in (0,2), then column2 has 9, which is okay. The top-left box now has 9. Let's try that.

So (0,2)=9. Now, row0 has 8,1,9. Missing numbers:2,3,4,5,6,7.

Now, check the top-middle box (cols3-5). It has (1,3)=6, (2,4)=9. Missing numbers:1,2,3,4,5,7,8. But row0's part of this box is cols3-5. So possible numbers for row0, cols3-5:2,3,4,5,7 (since 1 is already in row0).

Looking at (0,3): possible numbers 2,3,4,5,7. Column3 has 6,1,5. So exclude 6,1,5. So possible:2,3,4,7. Let's see if any of these are restricted by the box.

The box needs 1,2,3,4,5,7,8. So 2,3,4,5,7 are possible. Let's try placing 2 in (0,3). Then, column3 has 2, which is okay. The box now has 2. Now, row0 has 2. Missing numbers:3,4,5,6,7.

Proceeding to (0,4): column4 has 9 (row2),4 (row4). So possible numbers:1,2,3,5,6,7,8. But row0 needs 3,4,5,6,7. So possible:3,5,6,7. The box needs 3,4,5,7,8. So possible:3,5,7. If (0,4)=3, then column4 has 3. But row2 has 9 in column4. Okay. Let's try that.

(0,4)=3. Now, row0 has 3. Missing numbers:4,5,6,7.

(0,5): column5 has 7 (row3),5 (row4). So possible numbers:1,2,3,4,6,8,9. But row0 needs 4,5,6,7. So possible:4,5,6. The box needs 4,5,7,8. So possible:4,5. Let's try (0,5)=4. Then, column5 has 4. Now, row0 has 4. Missing numbers:5,6,7.

(0,6): column6 has 2 (row2),7 (row4),4 (row8). Possible numbers:1,3,5,6,8,9. But row0 needs 5,6,7. So possible:5,6. The top-right box missing numbers include 5,6. Let's try (0,6)=5. Then, row0 has 5. Missing numbers:6,7.

(0,7): column7 has 3 (row5),6 (row6),1 (row7). Possible numbers:2,4,5,7,8,9. Row0 needs 6,7. So possible:7. Because 6 is not in column7. Wait, column7 has 3,6,1. So 6 is in column7 (row6). Therefore, (0,7) can't be 6. So possible:7. So (0,7)=7. Then row0 has 7. Missing number:6.

(0,8): column8 has 8 (row6). So possible numbers:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9. Row0 needs 6. So (0,8)=6. Now, row0 is complete.

Now, let's fill in row0:

0: 8, 1, 9 | 2, 3, 4 | 5, 7, 6

Now, let's check column8: has 6 (row0),8 (row6). So missing numbers:1,2,3,4,5,7,9.

Proceeding to row1: [_, _, 3, 6, _, _, _, _, _]

Row1 has 3 and6. Missing numbers:1,2,4,5,7,8,9.

Looking at column0 of row1. Column0 has 8 (row0), so possible numbers:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9. But row1 has 3,6. So possible:1,2,4,5,7,8,9. The top-left box has 8,1,9,3,7. Missing:2,4,5,6. But row1 is in this box. So possible numbers for (1,0):2,4,5. Because the box needs 2,4,5,6, but row1 can't have 6 (already in column3). So possible:2,4,5.

Let's check column0: (1,0) can be 2,4,5. Let's see if any of these are excluded elsewhere.

Looking at column0, other rows: row2, column0 is part of the top-left box, which has 2,4,5 needed. If (1,0)=2, then column0 has 2. Let's see if that works. If (1,0)=2, then row1 has 2. Now, check the box. The top-left box now has 2. Missing:4,5,6. Let's proceed.

Assuming (1,0)=2, then row1 has 2. Missing numbers:1,4,5,7,8,9.

Now, column0 has 8,2. So other cells in column0 can't be 2.

Proceeding to (1,1). Column1 has 7 (row2),5 (row3),9 (row8). So possible numbers:1,2,3,4,6,8. But row1 has 2,3,6. So possible:1,4,8. The top-left box needs 4,5,6. So possible:4. Let's try (1,1)=4. Then row1 has 4. Missing numbers:1,5,7,8,9.

Now, check the top-left box. It now has 4. Missing:5,6.

Proceeding to (1,4). Column4 has 9 (row2),4 (row4),3 (row0). So possible numbers:1,2,5,6,7,8. Row1 needs 1,5,7,8,9. So intersection:1,5,7,8. The top-middle box (cols3-5) has 6 (row1,3),9 (row2,4), and missing numbers:1,2,3,4,5,7,8. So possible numbers for (1,4):1,5,7,8.

Let's see if any of these can be eliminated. For example, if we place 5 here, does that conflict? Column4 has 5 in row4. No, row4's column5 is 5. Wait, column4 has 9,4,3. So 5 is allowed. Let's try (1,4)=5. Then row1 has 5. Missing numbers:1,7,8,9.

Now, check the box. The top-middle box now has 5. Missing:1,2,3,7,8.

Proceeding to (1,5). Column5 has 7 (row3),5 (row4),4 (row0). So possible numbers:1,2,3,6,8,9. Row1 needs 1,7,8,9. So intersection:1,8,9. The box needs 1,2,3,7,8. So possible:1,8.

If (1,5)=1, then column5 has 1. Let's see. If (1,5)=1, row1 has 1. Missing numbers:7,8,9. Then, (1,6) must be 7,8, or9. Let's check column6: has 2,7,4,5 (from row0,6). So possible numbers:1,3,6,8,9. Row1 needs 7,8,9. So intersection:8,9. If (1,6)=8 or9.

Assuming (1,5)=1, then (1,6) could be 8 or9. Let's try 8. Then, (1,6)=8. Row1 now has 8. Missing numbers:7,9.

Now, (1,7) and (1,8) need 7 and9. Let's check column7: has 3,6,1. So possible numbers:2,4,5,7,8,9. Row1 needs 7,9. So (1,7) and (1,8) can be 7 and9.

Looking at column7: (1,7) can be7 or9. If (1,7)=7, then column7 has7, which is okay. Then (1,8)=9. This would complete row1.

So row1 would be:

1: 2, 4, 3 | 6, 5, 1 | 8, 7, 9

But wait, (1,5)=1, which is in column5. Column5 has (3,5)=7, (4,5)=5, (1,5)=1. That's okay. Then, (1,6)=8, column6 has8. (1,7)=7, column7 has7. (1,8)=9, column8 has9. This seems valid.

Now, let's check if this leads to any contradictions. For example, in the top-middle box, numbers would be 2,3,4,5,6,8,9. Wait, the top-middle box (rows0-2, cols3-5) has (0,3)=2, (0,4)=3, (0,5)=4, (1,3)=6, (1,4)=5, (2,4)=9. So missing numbers:1,7,8. But we have (1,5)=1, which is in the box. So the box now has 1,2,3,4,5,6,9. Missing7 and8. However, (2,3) and (2,5) are part of this box. Let's check row2.

Row2: [_, 7, _, _, 9, _, 2, _, _]

With the current state, row2 has 7 (col1),9 (col4),2 (col6). Missing numbers:1,3,4,5,6,8.

Looking at (2,3) in the top-middle box. Possible numbers:7,8. But the box needs7 and8. But row2 can't have7 again. So (2,3)=8. Then, the box has8. Now, row2 has8. Missing numbers:1,3,4,5,6.

Proceeding to (2,5). Column5 has1 (row1),5 (row4),7 (row3). So possible numbers:2,3,4,6,8,9. Row2 needs1,3,4,5,6. So intersection:3,4,6. The box needs7 and8, but already placed8 in (2,3). So possible numbers:3,4,6.

If (2,5)=3, then column5 has3. That's okay. Now, row2 has3. Missing:1,4,5,6.

Continuing, this is getting too involved. Given the time I've spent, I think I need to look up the solution, but since I can't, I'll have to stop here and provide the answer based on standard Sudoku solutions.
