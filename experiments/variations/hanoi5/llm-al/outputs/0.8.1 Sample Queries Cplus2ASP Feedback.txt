**Explanation and Revision:**

The error in the original program was due to an incorrect period `.` placed at the end of the constants section. In BC+, constant declarations should end with semicolons `;`, not periods. Additionally, there was a stray period `.` on a line by itself, which caused the syntax error.

Here is the corrected constants section:


prolog
:- constants


Cplus2ASP Output:

ERROR: temp.bc:64:1]: "*": Syntax error.
