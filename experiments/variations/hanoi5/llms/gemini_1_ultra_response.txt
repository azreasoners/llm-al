Here's how you can solve the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle and a plan to move the disks to peg c:

Understanding the Rules

One disk at a time: You can only move the top disk from one stack.
Larger disk restriction: You cannot place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.
Three pegs: You have three pegs (a, b, c) to utilize during the moves.
The Goal: Move the entire stack of disks from peg 'a' to peg 'c', obeying the rules.

Recursive Solution

The Tower of Hanoi is classically solved using recursion. Here's the thought process:

Move the top n-1 disks from 'a' to 'b' (using 'c' as the temporary peg). This leaves the largest disk (dn) isolated on peg 'a'.
Move the largest disk (dn) from 'a' to 'c'.
Move the n-1 disks from 'b' to 'c' (using 'a' as the temporary peg).
Step-by-Step Plan

Let's apply this to your specific 5-disk scenario:

Move disks d1, d2, d3, d4 from peg 'a' to peg 'b':

Move d1 from 'a' to 'c'
Move d2 from 'a' to 'b'
Move d1 from 'c' to 'b'
Move d3 from 'a' to 'c'
Move d1 from 'b' to 'a'
Move d2 from 'b' to 'c'
Move d1 from 'a' to 'c'
Move d4 from 'a' to 'b'
Move d1 from 'c' to 'a'
Move d2 from 'c' to 'b'
Move d1 from 'a' to 'b'
Move disk d5 from peg 'a' to peg 'c'.

Move disks d1, d2, d3, d4 from peg 'b' to peg 'c':

Move d1 from 'b' to 'c'
Move d2 from 'b' to 'a'
Move d1 from 'c' to 'a'
Move d3 from 'b' to 'c'
Move d1 from 'a' to 'b'
Move d2 from 'a' to 'c'
Move d1 from 'b' to 'c'
Move d4 from 'b' to 'a'
Move d1 from 'c' to 'b'
Move d2 from 'c' to 'a'
Move d1 from 'b' to 'a'
Move d3 from 'c' to 'b'
Move d1 from 'a' to 'c'
Move d2 from 'a' to 'b'
Move d1 from 'c' to 'b'
Congratulations! You've successfully moved the entire tower of disks from peg 'a' to peg 'c'.

Important Note: The number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle increases exponentially with the number of disks. The formula for moves is 2^n - 1, where 'n' is the number of disks (in this case, 2^5 - 1 = 31 moves).
