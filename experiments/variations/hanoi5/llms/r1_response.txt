Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to move all the disks from peg a to peg c, following the rules. The disks are stacked with d1 (the heaviest) at the bottom, then d2, d3, d4, and d5 on top. The goal is to have them all on peg c, probably in the same order, right? Because they have to be ordered from heaviest to lightest at the bottom up.

Wait, but the problem says "stack all disks on peg c" but doesn't specify the order. But since they have to be stacked such that a heavier disk isn't placed on a lighter one, the final stack must be ordered with the heaviest at the bottom. So the initial setup is d1 (heaviest) on a, then d2, d3, d4, d5. So the order from bottom to top is d1, d2, d3, d4, d5. But since d1 is heaviest, and each subsequent is lighter, the current stack is valid. But we need to move them all to peg c.

This reminds me of the Tower of Hanoi problem. The classic Tower of Hanoi has three disks, and the solution requires moving them one by one, never placing a larger disk on a smaller one. But here we have five disks, and the same rules apply. The difference here is that in the standard problem, the disks are ordered with the largest at the bottom and smallest on top, but here the heaviest is d1, which is the largest? Wait, in the problem statement, it says "From heaviest to lightest, the disks are d1, d2, d3, d4, and d5." So d1 is the heaviest, d2 next, down to d5 which is the lightest. So the initial stack is d1 (bottom), d2, d3, d4, d5 (top). So the sizes (or weights) are decreasing as we go up. But in the Tower of Hanoi, the rule is you can't place a larger disk on a smaller one. Here, the rule is similar: a disk cannot be moved onto another if it is heavier than it. So same as Tower of Hanoi. So this is a classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks, but the labels are d1 to d5 instead of sizes. So the solution would be similar to the standard Tower of Hanoi with 5 disks.

In the standard Tower of Hanoi, the minimal number of moves is 2^n - 1, so for 5 disks, 31 moves. But since the problem says "find a plan", I need to outline the steps. But writing all 31 steps would be tedious. However, maybe there's a pattern to follow. Let me recall the recursive approach: To move n disks from source to target, using an auxiliary peg:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg.

2. Move the nth disk (the largest one) from source to target.

3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary peg to target.

So applying this recursively. But in this case, the disks are labeled d1 (heaviest) to d5 (lightest). So the order from bottom to top is d1, d2, d3, d4, d5. To move all to peg c, the steps would be:

First, we need to move d5 (lightest) to a temporary peg, but wait, no. Wait, in the standard problem, the largest disk is at the bottom. So here, d1 is the largest, so moving it would require moving all other disks off first. But since they're stacked in order, each disk is on top of a heavier one. So to move d1, we need to move d2, d3, d4, d5 first. Wait, but the initial stack is d1 (on a), then d2 on d1, d3 on d2, etc. So the top disk is d5. So the first move would be to move d5 from a to another peg, say b or c. But since the goal is to stack all on c, perhaps the first steps involve moving the smaller disks to the auxiliary pegs.

But let's think step by step. Let's list the disks as d1 (heaviest) to d5 (lightest). The pegs are a, b, c. All disks start on a. We need to move them to c.

The standard solution for Tower of Hanoi with 5 disks would be:

1. Move d5 from a to c.

But wait, no. Wait, the standard solution starts by moving the top n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg. For 5 disks, the first step would be to move the top 4 disks (d2, d3, d4, d5) from a to b, using c as the auxiliary. Then move d1 from a to c. Then move the 4 disks from b to c using a as auxiliary. But since the initial stack is d1 (bottom), d2, d3, d4, d5 (top), the top disk is d5, which is the lightest. Wait, but in the standard Tower of Hanoi, the largest is at the bottom, but here, the heaviest is d1, which is the bottom. So the order is correct. So the problem is exactly the same as the standard Tower of Hanoi with 5 disks, where the largest is at the bottom, and each subsequent is smaller. So the standard solution applies.

But let's try to outline the steps. Since the user wants a plan, probably a list of moves. Each move is moving a single disk from one peg to another, following the rules: can't move a disk if there's another on top of it, and can't place a heavier disk on a lighter one.

The recursive approach would generate the steps. Let's see if I can outline them without making mistakes.

The steps for moving 5 disks from a to c:

1. Move 4 disks (d2, d3, d4, d5) from a to b, using c as auxiliary.

2. Move d1 from a to c.

3. Move 4 disks from b to c, using a as auxiliary.

To move 4 disks from a to b (step 1):

1.1. Move 3 disks (d3, d4, d5) from a to c, using b as auxiliary.

1.2. Move d2 from a to b.

1.3. Move 3 disks from c to b, using a as auxiliary.

But each of these steps would require further breakdown. Let's try to write the first few steps.

Starting with all disks on a: [d1, d2, d3, d4, d5] (bottom to top)

The first step is to move d5 (lightest) from a to c. But wait, can we do that? Because d5 is on top, so yes. But according to the Tower of Hanoi algorithm, the first move for n=5 is actually moving the top disk (d5) to the target peg. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the order. Let me check.

Wait, the standard algorithm for Tower of Hanoi with 3 disks starts with moving the smallest to the target peg. Wait, but for n=3, the steps are:

1. Move disk 1 (smallest) from a to c.

2. Move disk 2 from a to b.

3. Move disk 1 from c to b.

4. Move disk 3 (largest) from a to c.

5. Move disk 1 from b to a.

6. Move disk 2 from b to c.

7. Move disk 1 from a to c.

But in this problem, the disks are labeled d1 (heaviest) to d5 (lightest). So d5 is the smallest. So in this case, moving the smallest disk first.

But in the recursive approach, when moving n disks from source to target, the first step is to move the top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary. So for 5 disks, the first step is moving 4 disks (d2-d5) from a to b, using c as auxiliary. But to do that, you need to move d5 first. But perhaps it's easier to list the steps in order.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think of the sequence of moves required. Let me try to outline the steps, keeping track of the pegs each disk is on.

But this might take a while. Let me see if I can find a pattern or use the standard solution.

The minimal number of moves is 31. Let me try to generate the first few steps and see.

The standard solution alternates moving the smallest disk every other move. For example, in the 3-disk case, the smallest disk moves every other step. Similarly, for 5 disks, the smallest disk (d5) will move every other move. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, the sequence of moves can be determined using the binary counting method, but that might be more complex.

Alternatively, here's a way to generate the moves recursively.

Let's define a function to move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:

Function move(n, source, target, auxiliary):

if n == 1:

print("Move disk d" + n + " from " + source + " to " + target)

else:

move(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)

print("Move disk d" + n + " from " + source + " to " + target)

move(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

Wait, but wait, in our case, the disks are numbered d1 (heaviest) to d5 (lightest). So the largest disk is d1, then d2, etc., up to d5 as the lightest. But in the standard Tower of Hanoi, the largest disk is the nth disk. So in our case, n=5, but the largest is d1. So there's a discrepancy here. Wait, this is a key point. If the problem had the disks ordered from lightest to heaviest (d5 lightest, d1 heaviest), then the standard approach would apply directly. But in this problem, the order is reversed: d1 is heaviest, d2 next, etc., up to d5 as lightest. So the initial stack is d1 (bottom), d2, d3, d4, d5 (top). So to move them to c, the order should remain d1 at the bottom, then d2, etc., up to d5 on top.

But the standard Tower of Hanoi problem starts with disks ordered from largest (at bottom) to smallest (top). So in this case, our setup is the same as the standard problem, except the labeling is different. So the standard solution applies, but the labels are d1 (instead of disk 5), d2 (instead of disk 4), etc., up to d5 (disk 1, the smallest). So when we translate the standard solution steps into our labels, we have to adjust the disk numbers.

Wait, this is crucial. Let me clarify:

In the standard Tower of Hanoi with 5 disks, the disks are numbered 1 (smallest) to 5 (largest). So the steps involve moving disk 1, then disk 2, etc. But in our problem, the disks are labeled d1 (heaviest, largest) to d5 (lightest, smallest). So our d1 corresponds to the standard disk 5, d2 to disk 4, ..., d5 to disk 1.

Therefore, when the standard solution says "move disk 1", we should move d5; "move disk 2" corresponds to d4, and so on, up to "move disk 5" corresponds to d1.

So the steps in the standard solution for 5 disks would need to be translated by replacing each "disk n" with "disk d(6 - n)". For example:

Standard step: Move disk 1 → Move d5

Move disk 2 → Move d4

...

Move disk 5 → Move d1

Therefore, the entire sequence of 31 moves can be generated by taking the standard solution and replacing each disk number accordingly.

But how does the standard solution sequence look for 5 disks? Let's try to outline it.

The standard recursive solution for moving 5 disks from A to C would involve:

1. Move 4 disks from A to B, using C as auxiliary.

2. Move disk 5 from A to C.

3. Move 4 disks from B to C, using A as auxiliary.

But translating that into our problem:

1. Move 4 disks (d2, d3, d4, d5) from a to b, using c as auxiliary.

2. Move d1 from a to c.

3. Move 4 disks (d2, d3, d4, d5) from b to c, using a as auxiliary.

Then, to move the 4 disks, we recursively apply the same logic.

But to generate all the steps, perhaps it's easier to use the standard Tower of Hanoi sequence and map the disk numbers accordingly.

Alternatively, I can outline the steps using the standard method but substituting the disk labels.

Alternatively, here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Move d5 from a to c.

But wait, according to the standard solution, the first move is the smallest disk. So in our case, d5 is the smallest, so first move is d5 from a to c.

Then, next move would be the next smallest available disk. Wait, the Tower of Hanoi algorithm alternates moving the smallest disk and then the next possible disk. Let me think.

But perhaps it's better to generate the full sequence. Since the user wants a plan, maybe I can list the first few steps and then indicate that the pattern continues, but given the problem statement probably expects the full list.

But 31 steps would be a lot. Let me see if there's a systematic way to generate them.

Alternatively, here's the standard sequence for 5 disks (numbered 1 to 5, smallest to largest), moving from A to C:

1. Move 1 from A to C

2. Move 2 from A to B

3. Move 1 from C to B

4. Move 3 from A to C

5. Move 1 from B to A

6. Move 2 from B to C

7. Move 1 from A to C

8. Move 4 from A to B

9. Move 1 from C to B

10. Move 2 from C to A

11. Move 1 from B to A

12. Move 3 from C to B

13. Move 1 from A to C

14. Move 2 from A to B

15. Move 1 from C to B

16. Move 5 from A to C

17. Move 1 from B to A

18. Move 2 from B to C

19. Move 1 from A to C

20. Move 3 from B to A

21. Move 1 from C to B

22. Move 2 from C to A

23. Move 1 from B to A

24. Move 4 from B to C

25. Move 1 from A to C

26. Move 2 from A to B

27. Move 1 from C to B

28. Move 3 from A to C

29. Move 1 from B to A

30. Move 2 from B to C

31. Move 1 from A to C

Now, translating this to our disk labels where standard disk 1 is our d5, disk 2 is d4, disk 3 is d3, disk 4 is d2, disk 5 is d1:

Each move of disk n in the standard solution corresponds to moving d(6 - n) in our problem.

So:

1. Move 1 → Move d5 from A to C

2. Move 2 → Move d4 from A to B

3. Move 1 → Move d5 from C to B

4. Move 3 → Move d3 from A to C

5. Move 1 → Move d5 from B to A

6. Move 2 → Move d4 from B to C

7. Move 1 → Move d5 from A to C

8. Move 4 → Move d2 from A to B

9. Move 1 → Move d5 from C to B

10. Move 2 → Move d4 from C to A

11. Move 1 → Move d5 from B to A

12. Move 3 → Move d3 from C to B

13. Move 1 → Move d5 from A to C

14. Move 2 → Move d4 from A to B

15. Move 1 → Move d5 from C to B

16. Move 5 → Move d1 from A to C

17. Move 1 → Move d5 from B to A

18. Move 2 → Move d4 from B to C

19. Move 1 → Move d5 from A to C

20. Move 3 → Move d3 from B to A

21. Move 1 → Move d5 from C to B

22. Move 2 → Move d4 from C to A

23. Move 1 → Move d5 from B to A

24. Move 4 → Move d2 from B to C

25. Move 1 → Move d5 from A to C

26. Move 2 → Move d4 from A to B

27. Move 1 → Move d5 from C to B

28. Move 3 → Move d3 from A to C

29. Move 1 → Move d5 from B to A

30. Move 2 → Move d4 from B to C

31. Move 1 → Move d5 from A to C

So each of these steps, when translated, becomes moving the corresponding disk. So the full plan would be these 31 steps, replacing each standard disk number with our d(6 - n).

Therefore, the final answer is the list of these 31 moves, properly translated.

To solve the problem of moving all disks from peg a to peg c while adhering to the rules (heavier disks cannot be placed on lighter ones, and only the top disk of a stack can be moved), we use the Tower of Hanoi algorithm. The disks are ordered from heaviest (d1) to lightest (d5) initially stacked on peg a. Here's the step-by-step plan:

Move d5 from a to c

Move d4 from a to b

Move d5 from c to b

Move d3 from a to c

Move d5 from b to a

Move d4 from b to c

Move d5 from a to c

Move d2 from a to b

Move d5 from c to b

Move d4 from c to a

Move d5 from b to a

Move d3 from c to b

Move d5 from a to c

Move d4 from a to b

Move d5 from c to b

Move d1 from a to c

Move d5 from b to a

Move d4 from b to c

Move d5 from a to c

Move d3 from b to a

Move d5 from c to b

Move d4 from c to a

Move d5 from b to a

Move d2 from b to c

Move d5 from a to c

Move d4 from a to b

Move d5 from c to b

Move d3 from a to c

Move d5 from b to a

Move d4 from b to c

Move d5 from a to c

Final Configuration: All disks (d1, d2, d3, d4, d5) are stacked on peg c in order from heaviest at the bottom to lightest at the top.
