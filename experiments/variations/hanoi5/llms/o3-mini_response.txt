Okay, so the plan is to stack all the disks on peg C. We’ve got 5 disks here, from heaviest (d1) to lightest (d5), and they start on peg A in that order. The goal is to move them in the right sequence (d1 on the bottom, d5 on top) to peg C.

This is a classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle! We need to move everything from peg A to peg C, using peg B as an auxiliary. It usually takes 2^n - 1 moves, which means 31 moves.

In the classic Towers of Hanoi, the rules are: we can’t move a disk if there is another on top of it, and we can’t place a heavier disk on top of a lighter one. Our puzzle follows that same structure, but there's a twist: the disks are labeled from heaviest (d1) to lightest (d5), whereas typical problems have the smallest disk numbered first.

The solution is still the same—it’s just that the disk numbers are reversed. We can provide a sequence of 31 moves, following the classic algorithm for 5 disks.

Below is one valid sequence of moves to transfer the entire stack from peg a to peg c while obeying the rules. (Remember: you can only move a disk if nothing is on top of it, and you may never place a heavier disk on a lighter one.) In our notation, disk d1 is the heaviest and disk d5 the lightest. The following sequence is analogous to the classic Towers of Hanoi solution for 5 disks (31 moves in total):

Move d5 from a to c.
Move d4 from a to b.
Move d5 from c to b.
Move d3 from a to c.
Move d5 from b to a.
Move d4 from b to c.
Move d5 from a to c.
Move d2 from a to b.
Move d5 from c to b.
Move d4 from c to a.
Move d5 from b to a.
Move d3 from c to b.
Move d5 from a to c.
Move d4 from a to b.
Move d5 from c to b.
Move d1 from a to c.
Move d5 from b to a.
Move d4 from b to c.
Move d5 from a to c.
Move d3 from b to a.
Move d5 from c to b.
Move d4 from c to a.
Move d5 from b to a.
Move d2 from b to c.
Move d5 from a to c.
Move d4 from a to b.
Move d5 from c to b.
Move d3 from a to c.
Move d5 from b to a.
Move d4 from b to c.
Move d5 from a to c.
Explanation of the strategy:

First, the top four disks (d5, d4, d3, and d2) are moved (using peg c and peg b as needed) to free the heaviest disk d1.
Then d1 is moved directly from peg a to peg c.
Finally, the previously moved disks are transferred from their temporary peg onto d1 at peg c, recreating the stack in the correct order (largest at the bottom, smallest on top).
This plan successfully stacks all disks on peg c without ever violating the movement restrictions.
