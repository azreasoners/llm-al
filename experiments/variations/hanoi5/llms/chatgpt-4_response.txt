The problem described is a variation of the classic "Tower of Hanoi" puzzle, where the goal is to move a stack of disks from one peg to another, following specific rules. Given that all disks start on peg a and need to be moved to peg c in size order, we can solve this using a recursive approach.

In this specific case, you have 5 disks on peg a (d1 through d5, from bottom to top), and they need to be moved to peg c. Peg b will serve as the auxiliary peg to temporarily hold disks.

The basic recursive strategy to move n disks from a source peg to a target peg using an auxiliary peg is:

Move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.
Move the nth disk from the source peg to the target peg.
Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.
Let's apply this strategy to move the 5 disks:

Move disks d5, d4, d3, and d2 from peg a to peg b, using peg c as auxiliary.
Move disk d1 directly from peg a to peg c.
Move disks d5, d4, d3, and d2 from peg b to peg c, using peg a as auxiliary.
Let's simulate these steps recursively:

Here is the sequence of moves required to stack all disks from peg a to peg c, using peg b as an auxiliary:

Move disk d5 from peg a to peg c.
Move disk d4 from peg a to peg b.
Move disk d5 from peg c to peg b.
Move disk d3 from peg a to peg c.
Move disk d5 from peg b to peg a.
Move disk d4 from peg b to peg c.
Move disk d5 from peg a to peg c.
Move disk d2 from peg a to peg b.
Move disk d5 from peg c to peg b.
Move disk d4 from peg c to peg a.
Move disk d5 from peg b to peg a.
Move disk d3 from peg c to peg b.
Move disk d5 from peg a to peg c.
Move disk d4 from peg a to peg b.
Move disk d5 from peg c to peg b.
Move disk d1 from peg a to peg c.
Move disk d5 from peg b to peg a.
Move disk d4 from peg b to peg c.
Move disk d5 from peg a to peg c.
Move disk d3 from peg b to peg a.
Move disk d5 from peg c to peg b.
Move disk d4 from peg c to peg a.
Move disk d5 from peg b to peg a.
Move disk d2 from peg b to peg c.
Move disk d5 from peg a to peg c.
Move disk d4 from peg a to peg b.
Move disk d5 from peg c to peg b.
Move disk d3 from peg a to peg c.
Move disk d5 from peg b to peg a.
Move disk d4 from peg b to peg c.
Move disk d5 from peg a to peg c.
This completes the movement of all disks to peg c in the correct order.

def move_disks(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        # Base case: only one disk to move
        return [(source, target)]
    else:
        steps = []
        # Move top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, using target as temporary
        steps += move_disks(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        # Move the nth disk from source to target
        steps.append((source, target))
        # Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to target, using source as temporary
        steps += move_disks(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)
        return steps

# Move 5 disks from peg 'a' to peg 'c', using 'b' as auxiliary
move_steps = move_disks(5, 'a', 'c', 'b')
