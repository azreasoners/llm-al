Shifting the stack

I’m piecing together a strategy to transfer five disks from peg a to peg c, adhering to the rules: larger disks must sit below smaller ones, and only one disk may move at a time.

Mapping the solution

I’m starting with the initial and final states of the Tower of Hanoi for 5 disks. The initial state has all disks on peg A, while the final state has all disks on peg C.

Understanding disk order

I’m mapping out the disk arrangement in this problem, which labels them from largest to smallest, unlike the classic Tower of Hanoi. In standard notation, the smallest disk is labeled as disk 1.

Executing the method

I’m directing n disks from pegged A to C using B as an auxiliary by recursively shifting n-1 disks each time, placing the n-th disk on C, then moving the n-1 disks to C.

Crafting the function

I’m working through a recursive function for the Tower of Hanoi, handling n=5. The function will output the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.

Let's consider the process: I worked through the solution by recursively breaking down the problem, systematically moving disks from one rod to another, ensuring each step adhered to the rules, and then listing the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

Mapping the sequence

I’m listing the sequential movement of disks in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Each move identifies the disk number and its starting and ending positions.

Systemizing the steps

I’m laying out the sequence to move each disk, ensuring they go from 'a' to 'b' in a controlled fashion, adhering strictly to the rules of the game. Each move is carefully considered to maintain the necessary regulations.

Tracking the process

I’m noting the steps involved in moving disks from one peg to another, ensuring each move adheres to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. This systematic progression aids in achieving the desired configuration.

Revisiting the sequence. Each disk movement is adjusted for clarity and progression of the puzzle. This method ensures the moves are logically ordered and easy to understand.

To solve the problem of stacking all the disks on peg c, we'll use a well-known recursive strategy known as the Tower of Hanoi algorithm. This algorithm efficiently moves disks between pegs while following the given constraints:

A disk cannot be moved if there is another disk on top of it.
A disk cannot be moved onto another disk if it is heavier than the other disk.
Given the disks from heaviest to lightest as d1, d2, d3, d4, and d5, and the initial configuration with all disks on peg a, the plan involves a series of moves to transfer the disks to peg c using peg b as an auxiliary peg.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

Move d5 from a to c.
Move d4 from a to b.
Move d5 from c to b.
Move d3 from a to c.
Move d5 from b to a.
Move d4 from b to c.
Move d5 from a to c.
Move d2 from a to b.
Move d5 from c to b.
Move d4 from c to a.
Move d5 from b to a.
Move d3 from c to b.
Move d5 from a to c.
Move d4 from a to b.
Move d5 from c to b.
Move d1 from a to c.
Move d5 from b to a.
Move d4 from b to c.
Move d5 from a to c.
Move d3 from b to a.
Move d5 from c to b.
Move d4 from c to a.
Move d5 from b to a.
Move d2 from b to c.
Move d5 from a to c.
Move d4 from a to b.
Move d5 from c to b.
Move d3 from a to c.
Move d5 from b to a.
Move d4 from b to c.
Move d5 from a to c.
Explanation of the Plan:

Moves 1-7: We first move the smaller disks (d5, d4, and d3) to set up the move of the larger disk d2.
Move 8: We move d2 to peg b to free up d1.
Moves 9-15: We reposition the smaller disks to prepare for moving d1.
Move 16: We move the largest disk d1 to peg c.
Moves 17-31: We systematically move the smaller disks (d2, d3, d4, and d5) over d1 on peg c, completing the stack.
By following these steps, you will successfully stack all the disks on peg c in the correct order, adhering to the constraints of the problem.

Final Configuration on Peg c:

Bottom: d1 (heaviest)
Above d1: d2
Above d2: d3
Above d3: d4
Top: d5 (lightest)
This plan ensures that at every step, no heavier disk is placed on top of a lighter one, and no disk is moved if there's another disk on top of it.
