The Tower of Hanoi setup involves 5 disks and 3 pegs. The disks' sizes are not in a traditional order, as the problem states from heaviest to lightest. This makes me think about the importance of starting with the largest disk on peg a, but the reverse order complicates the steps.

Mapping the strategy

I’m mapping out the plan to move 5 disks from peg A to peg C in 31 moves using the Tower of Hanoi's canonical method. The initial disk stack order is crucial for the plan.

Ensuring proper stacking

I’m working through the rule of not placing a heavier disk on a lighter one. By ordering the disks from heaviest to lightest, I ensure compliance with the standard tower stacking constraints.

Taking a closer look

I’m mapping out the Tower of Hanoi solution, moving the top 4 disks to peg B in 15 steps, then transferring the largest disk to peg C, and finally moving the 4 disks from peg B to peg C in another 15 steps.

Formulating the strategy

I’m outlining a step-by-step plan to move 4 disks from peg A to peg B using peg C as an auxiliary. This structured method ensures no heavier disk is placed on a lighter one.

Moving the disks

I’ve outlined the steps to transfer the top 4 disks to peg B, ensuring they are arranged in the same order. The movements involve shifting disks between peg A, B, and C.

Shifting the largest disk

I’m moving the largest disk, d1, from peg A to peg C, leaving peg A empty and peg C with the largest disk while maintaining the same order.

Shifting the strategy

I’m transferring the 4 disks from peg B to peg C, using peg A as an auxiliary. This involves a carefully crafted 15-step procedure to ensure proper placement.

Transferring the disks

I’ve moved all 5 disks to peg C using peg A as an auxiliary. This involved a structured 31-step process, ensuring the disks were transferred correctly to peg C.

Below is one explicit step-by-step plan (the classic Tower of Hanoi solution) that moves all five disks from peg 
𝑎
a to peg 
𝑐
c, using peg 
𝑏
b as auxiliary.
