There are three types of things: location, disk, and peg.
disks and pegs are locations.

Problem Description:
To successfully stack disks in a tower, one needs to move disks off of other disks or pegs to achieve the desired ordered stack. A disk cannot be moved if there is another disk on top of it. A disk cannot be moved onto another if it is heavier than it.

There are five disks: d1, d2, d3, d4, and d5. There are three pegs: a, b, and c.

Disk d1 is on peg a. Disk d2 is on disk d1. Disk d3 is on disk d2. Disk d4 is on disk d3. Disk  d5 is on disk d4. From heaviest to lightest, the disks are d1, d2, d3, d4, and d5. Find a plan to stack all disks on peg c.
