Here is the complete solution to the Sudoku puzzle:

5 8 1 | 2 3 7 | 4 6 0
6 4 0 | 8 7 1 | 3 2 5
2 3 7 | 5 4 6 | 0 1 8
-----+-------+-----
3 6 4 | 0 5 8 | 1 7 2
7 0 2 | 1 6 4 | 5 8 3
8 5 3 | 7 0 2 | 6 4 1
-----+-------+-----
0 2 8 | 6 1 5 | 7 3 4
4 7 6 | 3 2 0 | 8 5 1
1 0 5 | 4 8 3 | 2 0 6

To explain the solution process:

Start with the given numbers in the puzzle.
Look for a row, column, or 3x3 box where there is only one possible number that can fit. Fill in that number.
Repeat step 2 until the puzzle is complete.
For this specific puzzle, after entering the given numbers, we can deduce:

In row 1, only 5 can go in column 1.
In row 2, 6 must go in column 1 and 4 in column 2.
In row 3, 2 must go in column 1.
In row 7, 0 is the only option for column 3.
In row 9, 1 is given in column 1 and 6 in column 6.
In column 9, 8 is the only option for row 3.
By continuing this process of elimination and deduction, filling in numbers that can only go in one spot based on the constraints, the entire Sudoku puzzle can be logically solved without any guesswork.
