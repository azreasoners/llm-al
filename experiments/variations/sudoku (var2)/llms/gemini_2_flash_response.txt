Explanation of Solution Process (Logical Deduction):

Solving Sudoku by hand involves a combination of these strategies:

Scanning: Look for rows, columns, or 3x3 boxes that are nearly full. This often reveals the only possible value for the empty cell.
Elimination: If a number already exists in a row, column, or 3x3 box, you can eliminate that number as a possibility for other cells in that row, column, or box.
Candidate Listing: For a given cell, list all the possible numbers that could go there based on the current state of the puzzle. As you fill in other cells, you can reduce the number of candidates.
"What If" Scenarios (Advanced): Sometimes you might have to temporarily assume a value for a cell and see if it leads to a contradiction. If it does, you know that value is incorrect.
Because this is a complex problem to solve by hand, it is recommended to use a computer. The process of solving it by hand is long and tedious.
