So I've got this Sudoku puzzle to solve. I'm not super experienced with Sudoku, but I know the basics. The goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, making sure that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repeating any.

First, I need to understand the given setup. There are some cells already filled in, and I need to fill in the rest. Let me list out the given cells:

- Row 1, Column 2: 9

- Row 1, Column 4: 3

- Row 1, Column 9: 1

- Row 2, Column 5: 8

- Row 2, Column 8: 4

- Row 2, Column 9: 6

- Row 3, Column 7: 8

- Row 4, Column 1: 4

- Row 4, Column 3: 5

- Row 4, Column 5: 6

- Row 4, Column 8: 3

- Row 5, Column 3: 3

- Row 5, Column 4: 2

- Row 5, Column 5: 7

- Row 5, Column 6: 5

- Row 5, Column 7: 6

- Row 6, Column 2: 6

- Row 6, Column 5: 1

- Row 6, Column 7: 9

- Row 6, Column 9: 4

- Row 7, Column 3: 1

- Row 8, Column 1: 5

- Row 8, Column 2: 8

- Row 8, Column 5: 2

- Row 9, Column 1: 2

- Row 9, Column 6: 7

- Row 9, Column 8: 6

That's a lot of givens! Maybe it'll make the puzzle easier to solve.

I think the best way to approach this is to start filling in the grid step by step, considering the constraints for rows, columns, and subgrids.

First, I should probably sketch out the grid and mark the given numbers in their respective positions.

Let me create a 9x9 grid and label the rows and columns from 0 to 8, as indicated.

Wait, actually, in standard Sudoku, rows and columns are labeled from 1 to 9, but here it seems rows and columns are labeled from 0 to 8. I need to confirm that.

Looking back, the problem says: "0..8 are rows. 0..8 are columns." So yes, rows and columns are labeled from 0 to 8, which is a bit unusual, but I'll go with that.

So, Row 0 to Row 8, Column 0 to Column 8.

Now, let's list the given cells again with rows and columns from 0 to 8:

- Row 1, Column 2: 9

- Row 1, Column 4: 3

- Row 1, Column 8: 1

- Row 2, Column 5: 8

- Row 2, Column 8: 4

- Row 2, Column 9: 6 → Wait, Column 9 doesn't exist; it should be Column 8 is the last one. Maybe it's a typo.

Wait, columns are 0 to 8, so Column 9 is invalid. Probably it's Column 8.

Similarly, check other rows:

- Row 3, Column 7: 8

- Row 4, Column 1: 4

- Row 4, Column 3: 5

- Row 4, Column 5: 6

- Row 4, Column 8: 3

- Row 5, Column 3: 3

- Row 5, Column 4: 2

- Row 5, Column 5: 7

- Row 5, Column 6: 5

- Row 5, Column 7: 6

- Row 6, Column 2: 6

- Row 6, Column 5: 1

- Row 6, Column 7: 9

- Row 6, Column 9: 4 → Again, Column 9 should be Column 8.

- Row 7, Column 3: 1

- Row 8, Column 1: 5

- Row 8, Column 2: 8

- Row 8, Column 5: 2

- Row 9, Column 1: 2 → Row 9 doesn't exist; it should be Row 8 is the last one.

- Row 9, Column 6: 7

- Row 9, Column 8: 6

Wait, there are rows and columns labeled up to 9, but earlier it said 0 to 8. This is confusing.

Let me clarify: if rows and columns are labeled from 0 to 8, then there is no Row 9 or Column 9. So, any reference to Row 9 or Column 9 is likely a mistake.

Perhaps the problem intended rows and columns to be labeled from 1 to 9, and the numbers were listed starting from 0.

Alternatively, maybe it's a zero-indexed grid, which is unusual for Sudoku but possible.

To avoid confusion, I'll assume that rows and columns are labeled from 0 to 8.

So, adjusting the given cells accordingly:

- Row 1, Column 2: 9

- Row 1, Column 4: 3

- Row 1, Column 8: 1

- Row 2, Column 5: 8

- Row 2, Column 8: 4

- Row 2, Column 9: 6 → Ignore this, as Column 9 doesn't exist.

- Row 3, Column 7: 8

- Row 4, Column 1: 4

- Row 4, Column 3: 5

- Row 4, Column 5: 6

- Row 4, Column 8: 3

- Row 5, Column 3: 3

- Row 5, Column 4: 2

- Row 5, Column 5: 7

- Row 5, Column 6: 5

- Row 5, Column 7: 6

- Row 6, Column 2: 6

- Row 6, Column 5: 1

- Row 6, Column 7: 9

- Row 6, Column 9: 4 → Ignore Column 9.

- Row 7, Column 3: 1

- Row 8, Column 1: 5

- Row 8, Column 2: 8

- Row 8, Column 5: 2

- Row 9, Column 1: 2 → Ignore Row 9.

- Row 9, Column 6: 7 → Ignore Row 9.

- Row 9, Column 8: 6 → Ignore Row 9.

So, after ignoring the invalid rows and columns, the valid givens are:

- (1,2):9

- (1,4):3

- (1,8):1

- (2,5):8

- (2,8):4

- (3,7):8

- (4,1):4

- (4,3):5

- (4,5):6

- (4,8):3

- (5,3):3

- (5,4):2

- (5,5):7

- (5,6):5

- (5,7):6

- (6,2):6

- (6,5):1

- (6,7):9

- (7,3):1

- (8,1):5

- (8,2):8

- (8,5):2

Is that all? It seems like some of the original entries were invalid due to incorrect row or column numbers.

Now, I need to sketch a 9x9 grid labeled from Row 0 to Row 8 and Column 0 to Column 8, and mark the given numbers in their positions.

Since I can't actually draw it here, I'll imagine it.

Let me try to visualize the grid:

Rows 0 to 8, Columns 0 to 8.

Given cells:

- Row 1, Column 2: 9

- Row 1, Column 4: 3

- Row 1, Column 8: 1

- Row 2, Column 5: 8

- Row 2, Column 8: 4

- Row 3, Column 7: 8

- Row 4, Column 1: 4

- Row 4, Column 3: 5

- Row 4, Column 5: 6

- Row 4, Column 8: 3

- Row 5, Column 3: 3

- Row 5, Column 4: 2

- Row 5, Column 5: 7

- Row 5, Column 6: 5

- Row 5, Column 7: 6

- Row 6, Column 2: 6

- Row 6, Column 5: 1

- Row 6, Column 7: 9

- Row 7, Column 3: 1

- Row 8, Column 1: 5

- Row 8, Column 2: 8

- Row 8, Column 5: 2

Alright, now I need to start filling in the missing cells while ensuring that no row, column, or 3x3 subgrid has duplicate numbers from 1 to 9.

I think I'll start by looking for cells where only one number can fit based on the constraints.

First, let's consider Row 1: it has cells (1,2)=9, (1,4)=3, (1,8)=1.

So, Row 1 has 9, 3, and 1 already placed.

Therefore, the remaining cells in Row 1 need to have the numbers 2,4,5,6,7,8,9, but excluding the numbers already present in that row.

Wait, actually, since it's a 9x9 grid with numbers 1-9, each row must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once.

So, in Row 1, we have 9,3,1, and the rest need to have the remaining numbers: 2,4,5,6,7,8.

But I need to consider the columns and subgrids as well.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for cells where only one number can fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for subgrids where only one cell can accommodate a particular number.

Let me try to find a cell where only one number is possible.

Looking at Row 1: cells (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) are empty.

In Row 1, the existing numbers are 9,3,1.

So, the possible numbers for the empty cells in Row 1 are the numbers not yet in Row 1: 2,4,5,6,7,8.

But I need to see which of these numbers are allowed in each cell, considering the column and subgrid constraints.

This seems too vague. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Perhaps I can look for a subgrid where only one cell can contain a specific number.

Let's consider the subgrids. The 9x9 grid is divided into 9 subgrids of 3x3.

Labeling the subgrids as follows:

Subgrid 0: Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2

Subgrid 1: Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5

Subgrid 2: Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8

Subgrid 3: Rows 3-5, Columns 0-2

Subgrid 4: Rows 3-5, Columns 3-5

Subgrid 5: Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8

Subgrid 6: Rows 6-8, Columns 0-2

Subgrid 7: Rows 6-8, Columns 3-5

Subgrid 8: Rows 6-8, Columns 6-8

Now, let's look at Subgrid 0: Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2.

Looking at the given cells, none of the cells in Subgrid 0 are given, except for Row 1, Column 2 = 9, which is on the border of Subgrid 0 and Subgrid 1.

Wait, Row 1, Column 2 is in Subgrid 0.

Similarly, Row 2, Column 5 = 8 is in Subgrid 1.

Wait, Row 2, Column 5 is in Subgrid 1 (Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5).

Wait, Subgrid 1 is Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5.

Row 2, Column 5 is in Subgrid 1.

Similarly, Row 1, Column 2 is in Subgrid 0.

Wait, Row 1, Column 2 is (1,2), which is in Subgrid 0.

Wait, Subgrid 0 is Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2.

Row 1, Column 2 is (1,2), which is in Subgrid 0.

Similarly, Row 2, Column 5 is (2,5), which is in Subgrid 1.

Okay, let's list the given cells in their respective subgrids.

Given cells:

- (1,2)=9 → Subgrid 0

- (1,4)=3 → Subgrid 1

- (1,8)=1 → Subgrid 2

- (2,5)=8 → Subgrid 1

- (2,8)=4 → Subgrid 2

- (3,7)=8 → Subgrid 5

- (4,1)=4 → Subgrid 1

- (4,3)=5 → Subgrid 1

- (4,5)=6 → Subgrid 1

- (4,8)=3 → Subgrid 2

- (5,3)=3 → Subgrid 1

- (5,4)=2 → Subgrid 1

- (5,5)=7 → Subgrid 1

- (5,6)=5 → Subgrid 1

- (5,7)=6 → Subgrid 1

- (6,2)=6 → Subgrid 2

- (6,5)=1 → Subgrid 1

- (6,7)=9 → Subgrid 5

- (7,3)=1 → Subgrid 1

- (8,1)=5 → Subgrid 1

- (8,2)=8 → Subgrid 0

- (8,5)=2 → Subgrid 1

Wow, Subgrid 1 has a lot of given numbers.

Subgrid 1: Rows 3-5, Columns 3-5.

Given cells in Subgrid 1:

- (4,3)=5

- (4,5)=6

- (5,3)=3

- (5,4)=2

- (5,5)=7

- (5,6)=5

- (5,7)=6

- (6,5)=1

- (8,5)=2

Wait, Row 5, Column 7 = 6 is actually in Subgrid 2 (Rows 6-8, Columns 6-8).

Wait, no, Subgrid 1 is Rows 3-5, Columns 3-5.

Wait, Row 5, Column 7 is (5,7), which is in Subgrid 1.

Wait, no, Subgrid 1 is Rows 3-5, Columns 3-5.

Row 5, Column 7 is outside Subgrid 1; it should be in Subgrid 5.

Wait, Subgrid 5 is Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8.

So, Row 5, Column 7 is in Subgrid 5.

Similarly, Row 6, Column 5 is (6,5), which is in Subgrid 5.

Wait, Subgrid 5 is Rows 6-8, Columns 6-8.

Wait, no: Subgrid 5 is Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8.

Wait, perhaps I confused the subgrid labeling.

Let me redefine the subgrids correctly.

Standard Sudoku divides the 9x9 grid into 9 subgrids of 3x3:

Subgrid 0: Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2

Subgrid 1: Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5

Subgrid 2: Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8

Subgrid 3: Rows 3-5, Columns 0-2

Subgrid 4: Rows 3-5, Columns 3-5

Subgrid 5: Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8

Subgrid 6: Rows 6-8, Columns 0-2

Subgrid 7: Rows 6-8, Columns 3-5

Subgrid 8: Rows 6-8, Columns 6-8

So, Row 5, Column 7 is (5,7), which is Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8 → Subgrid 5.

Row 6, Column 5 is (6,5), which is Rows 6-8, Columns 3-5 → Subgrid 7.

Okay, now I need to correctly assign the given cells to their subgrids.

Given cells:

- (1,2)=9 → Subgrid 0

- (1,4)=3 → Subgrid 1

- (1,8)=1 → Subgrid 2

- (2,5)=8 → Subgrid 1

- (2,8)=4 → Subgrid 2

- (3,7)=8 → Subgrid 5

- (4,1)=4 → Subgrid 1

- (4,3)=5 → Subgrid 1

- (4,5)=6 → Subgrid 1

- (4,8)=3 → Subgrid 2

- (5,3)=3 → Subgrid 1

- (5,4)=2 → Subgrid 1

- (5,5)=7 → Subgrid 1

- (5,6)=5 → Subgrid 1

- (5,7)=6 → Subgrid 5

- (6,2)=6 → Subgrid 2

- (6,5)=1 → Subgrid 7

- (6,7)=9 → Subgrid 5

- (7,3)=1 → Subgrid 1

- (8,1)=5 → Subgrid 1

- (8,2)=8 → Subgrid 0

- (8,5)=2 → Subgrid 7

Wait, Subgrid 1 has a lot of given cells.

Subgrid 1: Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5.

Given cells in Subgrid 1:

- (1,4)=3

- (2,5)=8

- (4,3)=5

- (4,5)=6

- (5,3)=3

- (5,4)=2

- (5,5)=7

- (5,6)=5

- (5,7)=6

- (7,3)=1

- (8,5)=2

Wait, some of these are not in Subgrid 1.

Wait, Subgrid 1 is Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5.

So:

- (1,4)=3 is in Subgrid 1 (Row 1, Column 4)

- (2,5)=8 is in Subgrid 1 (Row 2, Column 5)

- (4,3)=5 is in Subgrid 1 (Row 4, Column 3)

- (4,5)=6 is in Subgrid 1 (Row 4, Column 5)

- (5,3)=3 is in Subgrid 1 (Row 5, Column 3)

- (5,4)=2 is in Subgrid 1 (Row 5, Column 4)

- (5,5)=7 is in Subgrid 1 (Row 5, Column 5)

- (5,6)=5 is in Subgrid 1 (Row 5, Column 6)

- (5,7)=6 is in Subgrid 5 (Row 5, Column 7)

- (6,5)=1 is in Subgrid 7 (Row 6, Column 5)

- (7,3)=1 is in Subgrid 1 (Row 7, Column 3)

- (8,5)=2 is in Subgrid 7 (Row 8, Column 5)

So, correcting that:

Given cells in Subgrid 1:

- (1,4)=3

- (2,5)=8

- (4,3)=5

- (4,5)=6

- (5,3)=3

- (5,4)=2

- (5,5)=7

- (5,6)=5

- (7,3)=1

Similarly, Subgrid 5: Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8.

Given cells in Subgrid 5:

- (3,7)=8

- (5,7)=6

- (6,7)=9

Wait, Row 6 is in Subgrid 8 (Rows 6-8, Columns 6-8).

Wait, Subgrid 5 is Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8.

So, (3,7)=8 is in Subgrid 5.

(5,7)=6 is in Subgrid 5.

(6,7)=9 is in Subgrid 8 (Rows 6-8, Columns 6-8).

So, in Subgrid 5:

- (3,7)=8

- (5,7)=6

Similarly, Subgrid 2: Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8.

Given cells in Subgrid 2:

- (1,8)=1

- (2,8)=4

- (6,2)=6 is in Subgrid 2 (Rows 6-8, Columns 0-2)

Wait, no, Subgrid 2 is Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8.

So, (6,2)=6 is in Subgrid 6 (Rows 6-8, Columns 0-2).

Wait, Subgrid 6: Rows 6-8, Columns 0-2.

Given cells in Subgrid 6:

- (6,2)=6

Similarly, Subgrid 0: Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2.

Given cells in Subgrid 0:

- (8,2)=8

Wait, Row 8, Column 2 is (8,2), which is in Subgrid 6 (Rows 6-8, Columns 0-2).

Wait, no: Subgrid 6 is Rows 6-8, Columns 0-2.

So, (8,2)=8 is in Subgrid 6.

Similarly, (1,2)=9 is in Subgrid 0.

Wait, Row 1, Column 2 is (1,2), which is in Subgrid 0.

Wait, Subgrid 0 is Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2.

Row 1, Column 2 is (1,2), which is in Subgrid 0.

Similarly, (8,2)=8 is in Subgrid 6.

Okay, I need to organize this better.

Let me list the given cells with their subgrids:

- (1,2)=9 → Subgrid 0

- (1,4)=3 → Subgrid 1

- (1,8)=1 → Subgrid 2

- (2,5)=8 → Subgrid 1

- (2,8)=4 → Subgrid 2

- (3,7)=8 → Subgrid 5

- (4,1)=4 → Subgrid 1

- (4,3)=5 → Subgrid 1

- (4,5)=6 → Subgrid 1

- (4,8)=3 → Subgrid 2

- (5,3)=3 → Subgrid 1

- (5,4)=2 → Subgrid 1

- (5,5)=7 → Subgrid 1

- (5,6)=5 → Subgrid 1

- (5,7)=6 → Subgrid 5

- (6,2)=6 → Subgrid 6

- (6,5)=1 → Subgrid 7

- (6,7)=9 → Subgrid 5

- (7,3)=1 → Subgrid 1

- (8,1)=5 → Subgrid 1

- (8,2)=8 → Subgrid 6

- (8,5)=2 → Subgrid 7

Okay, now that I have a better understanding of where the given cells are placed in the subgrids, perhaps I can start filling in some cells.

Looking at Subgrid 1: Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5.

Given cells in Subgrid 1:

- (1,4)=3

- (2,5)=8

- (4,3)=5

- (4,5)=6

- (5,3)=3

- (5,4)=2

- (5,5)=7

- (5,6)=5

- (7,3)=1

Wait, hold on. Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5 correspond to cells:

- (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)

- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)

- (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)

Given cells in this subgrid:

- (1,4)=3

- (2,5)=8

So, only these two are in Subgrid 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought there were more, but actually, the rows 4 and 5 are outside Subgrid 1.

Wait, Subgrid 1 is Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5.

So, any cell with Row >=3 is not in Subgrid 1.

Therefore, the given cells in Subgrid 1 are only:

- (1,4)=3

- (2,5)=8

Similarly, Subgrid 5 is Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8.

Given cells in Subgrid 5:

- (3,7)=8

- (5,7)=6

- (6,7)=9 (which is actually in Subgrid 8)

Wait, Subgrid 5 is Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8.

So, (3,7)=8 is in Subgrid 5.

(5,7)=6 is in Subgrid 5.

(6,7)=9 is in Subgrid 8.

So, in Subgrid 5:

- (3,7)=8

- (5,7)=6

Similarly, Subgrid 2: Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8.

Given cells in Subgrid 2:

- (1,8)=1

- (2,8)=4

Similarly, Subgrid 6: Rows 6-8, Columns 0-2.

Given cells in Subgrid 6:

- (6,2)=6

- (8,2)=8

Similarly, Subgrid 7: Rows 6-8, Columns 3-5.

Given cells in Subgrid 7:

- (6,5)=1

- (8,5)=2

Okay, now that I have a clearer picture of the subgrids and the given cells, perhaps I can start trying to fill in some cells.

Let me consider Row 1: Cells (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)=9, (1,3), (1,4)=3, (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8)=1.

So, in Row 1, the given numbers are 9 and 1, and 3.

Therefore, the missing numbers are 2,4,5,6,7,8.

But I need to see which of these can be placed in each empty cell, considering the column and subgrid constraints.

Let me look at Cell (1,0):

- Row 1: missing 2,4,5,6,7,8

- Column 0: what's in Column 0?

Looking at Column 0:

- Row 0: empty

- Row 1: (1,0)

- Row 2: empty

- Row 3: empty

- Row 4: (4,0)=?

Wait, no, rows are 0-8.

Wait, given cells don't have any in Column 0 except possibly in Row 4.

Wait, checking the given cells, none are in Column 0 except possibly in Row 4.

Wait, (4,1)=4 is in Column 1, not Column 0.

So, Column 0 is entirely empty except possibly in Row 4.

Wait, (4,0)=?

Looking back at the given cells, none are in Column 0.

So, Column 0 has no given numbers.

Subgrid 0: Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2.

Given cells in Subgrid 0:

- (1,2)=9

- (8,2)=8 (which is in Subgrid 6, not Subgrid 0)

Wait, (8,2)=8 is in Subgrid 6.

So, in Subgrid 0, only (1,2)=9 is given.

Therefore, in Cell (1,0):

- Row 1 missing: 2,4,5,6,7,8

- Column 0: no constraints

- Subgrid 0: only (1,2)=9

So, possible numbers for (1,0): exclude 9 from 1-9, since Subgrid 0 has 9.

So, possible: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 minus 9 and considering Row 1's missing numbers.

Wait, Row 1 has 9 already in (1,2), so in Row 1, we can't have another 9.

But Column 0 has no constraints.

Subgrid 0 has 9 in (1,2).

Therefore, for Cell (1,0), possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 minus 9, and considering Row 1's missing numbers: 2,4,5,6,7,8.

So, possible: 2,4,5,6,7,8.

Similarly, for Cell (1,1):

- Row 1 missing: 2,4,5,6,7,8

- Column 1: what's in Column 1?

Looking at Column 1:

- Row 0: empty

- Row 1: (1,1)

- Row 2: empty

- Row 3: empty

- Row 4: (4,1)=4

- Row 5: empty

- Row 6: empty

- Row 7: empty

- Row 8: (8,1)=5

So, in Column 1, given numbers are 4 and 5.

Therefore, in Cell (1,1), possible numbers are Row 1's missing numbers: 2,4,5,6,7,8, minus the Column 1's given numbers 4 and 5.

So, possible: 2,6,7,8

Subgrid 0: Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2.

Given cell: (1,2)=9

So, in Subgrid 0, 9 is present.

Therefore, for Cell (1,1), possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 minus 9, but considering Row 1's missing numbers and Column 1's constraints.

Already, we have 2,6,7,8 as possible.

Similarly, for Cell (1,3):

- Row 1 missing: 2,4,5,6,7,8

- Column 3: what's in Column 3?

Looking at Column 3:

- Row 0: empty

- Row 1: (1,3)

- Row 2: empty

- Row 3: empty

- Row 4: (4,3)=5

- Row 5: (5,3)=3

- Row 6: empty

- Row 7: (7,3)=1

- Row 8: empty

So, in Column 3, given numbers are 5,3,1.

Therefore, for Cell (1,3), possible numbers are Row 1's missing numbers: 2,4,5,6,7,8, minus Column 3's given numbers: 5,3,1.

So, possible: 2,4,6,7,8

Subgrid 0: Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2.

Given cell: (1,2)=9

So, in Subgrid 0, 9 is present.

Therefore, for Cell (1,3), possible numbers are 1-9 minus 9, minus Row 1's missing排除的数字，以及Column 3的已给数字。

已经得到2,4,6,7,8。

Similarly, for Cell (1,5):

- Row 1 missing: 2,4,5,6,7,8

- Column 5: what's in Column 5?

Looking at Column 5:

- Row 0: empty

- Row 1: (1,5)

- Row 2: (2,5)=8

- Row 3: empty

- Row 4: (4,5)=6

- Row 5: (5,5)=7

- Row 6: (6,5)=1

- Row 7: empty

- Row 8: (8,5)=2

So, in Column 5, given numbers are 8,6,7,1,2.

Therefore, for Cell (1,5), possible numbers are Row 1's missing numbers: 2,4,5,6,7,8, minus Column 5's given numbers: 8,6,7,1,2.

So, possible: 4,5

Subgrid 1: Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5.

Given cells: (1,4)=3, (2,5)=8

So, in Subgrid 1, numbers 3 and 8 are present.

Therefore, for Cell (1,5), possible numbers are 1-9 minus 3,8, minus Row 1's missing numbers and Column 5's given numbers.

From earlier, possible: 4,5

So, possible: 4,5

Similarly, for Cell (1,6):

- Row 1 missing: 2,4,5,6,7,8

- Column 6: what's in Column 6?

Looking at Column 6:

- Row 0: empty

- Row 1: (1,6)

- Row 2: empty

- Row 3: empty

- Row 4: empty

- Row 5: (5,6)=5

- Row 6: empty

- Row 7: empty

- Row 8: empty

So, in Column 6, given number is 5.

Therefore, for Cell (1,6), possible numbers are Row 1's missing numbers: 2,4,5,6,7,8, minus Column 6's given number: 5.

So, possible: 2,4,6,7,8

Subgrid 1: Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5.

Wait, no, Cell (1,6) is in Subgrid 1 (Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5).

Wait, Columns 3-5 are Columns 3,4,5.

Column 6 is outside Subgrid 1.

Wait, no, Subgrid 1 is Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5.

Cell (1,6) is Row 1, Column 6, which is in Subgrid 2 (Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8).

Wait, Subgrid 2 is Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8.

So, Cell (1,6) is in Subgrid 2.

Given cells in Subgrid 2:

- (1,8)=1

- (2,8)=4

So, in Subgrid 2, given numbers are 1 and 4.

Therefore, for Cell (1,6), possible numbers are 1-9 minus Subgrid 2's given numbers: 1,4, minus Row 1's missing numbers: 2,4,5,6,7,8, minus Column 6's given number: 5.

So, possible: 2,6,7,8

Similarly, for Cell (1,7):

- Row 1 missing: 2,4,5,6,7,8

- Column 7: what's in Column 7?

Looking at Column 7:

- Row 0: empty

- Row 1: (1,7)

- Row 2: empty

- Row 3: (3,7)=8

- Row 4: empty

- Row 5: (5,7)=6

- Row 6: (6,7)=9

- Row 7: empty

- Row 8: empty

So, in Column 7, given numbers are 8,6,9.

Therefore, for Cell (1,7), possible numbers are Row 1's missing numbers: 2,4,5,6,7,8, minus Column 7's given numbers: 8,6,9.

So, possible: 2,4,5,7

Subgrid 2: Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8.

Given cells: (1,8)=1, (2,8)=4

So, in Subgrid 2, given numbers are 1 and 4.

Therefore, for Cell (1,7), possible numbers are 1-9 minus 1,4, minus Row 1's missing numbers and Column 7's given numbers.

From earlier, possible: 2,4,5,7

But, 4 is in Subgrid 2, so it can't be used here.

Therefore, possible: 2,5,7

Wait, Subgrid 2 has 1 and 4, so possible numbers are 2,3,5,6,7,8,9 minus Row 1's missing numbers and Column 7's given numbers.

From Row 1's missing: 2,4,5,6,7,8

Column 7's given: 8,6,9

So, possible: 2,5,7

Similarly, for Cell (1,0), possible: 2,4,5,6,7,8

For Cell (1,1): 2,6,7,8

For Cell (1,3): 2,4,6,7,8

For Cell (1,5): 4,5

For Cell (1,6): 2,6,7,8

For Cell (1,7): 2,5,7

Looking at Cell (1,5): only 4 and 5 are possible.

Looking at Row 1, Column 5.

Looking at Column 5, given numbers are 8,6,7,1,2.

Row 1's missing numbers are 2,4,5,6,7,8.

Intersecting these, possible are 4 and 5.

So, Cell (1,5) can only be 4 or 5.

Similarly, looking at Cell (1,7): possible 2,5,7

Looking at Cell (1,6): possible 2,6,7,8

Looking at Cell (1,3): possible 2,4,6,7,8

Looking at Cell (1,1): possible 2,6,7,8

Looking at Cell (1,0): possible 2,4,5,6,7,8

This seems too vague. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can look for a number that can only go in one cell in a row, column, or subgrid.

Let me try that.

Looking at Subgrid 0: Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2.

Given cell: (1,2)=9

So, in Subgrid 0, 9 is present.

What numbers are missing in Subgrid 0?

Possible numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 minus 9.

So, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Looking at the cells in Subgrid 0:

- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)

- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)=9

- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)

Looking at Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)=9

Possible numbers for Row 1: 2,4,5,6,7,8

So, in Subgrid 0, Row 1 has (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)=9

Looking at Column 2: (0,2), (1,2)=9, (2,2)

Looking at Column 1: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)

Looking at Column 0: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)

Looking at Row 0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)

Looking at Row 2: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)

This seems too complicated. Maybe I should try a different subgrid.

Looking at Subgrid 1: Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5.

Given cells: (1,4)=3, (2,5)=8

Possible numbers in Subgrid 1: 1,2,4,5,6,7,9 minus the given numbers 3 and 8.

Wait, Subgrid 1 has (1,4)=3 and (2,5)=8.

So, in Subgrid 1, numbers 3 and 8 are present.

Therefore, missing numbers in Subgrid 1 are 1,2,4,5,6,7,9.

But, looking at Column 5: (0,5), (1,5), (2,5)=8, (3,5), (4,5)=6, (5,5)=7, (6,5)=1, (7,5), (8,5)=2

So, in Column 5, given numbers are 8,6,7,1,2.

Therefore, possible numbers for Cell (0,5): 3,4,5,9

But, in Subgrid 1, 3 is already in (1,4)=3.

So, for Cell (0,5), possible numbers are 4,5,9

Similarly, for Cell (0,3): in Subgrid 1, possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,6,7,9 minus Column 3's given numbers.

Looking at Column 3: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)=5, (5,3)=3, (6,3), (7,3)=1, (8,3)

So, in Column 3, given numbers are 5,3,1.

Therefore, for Cell (0,3), possible numbers are 2,4,6,7,9

Similarly, for Cell (0,4): in Subgrid 1, possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,6,7,9 minus Column 4's given numbers.

Looking at Column 4: (0,4), (1,4)=3, (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)=2, (5,4)=5, (6,4), (7,4), (8,4)

So, in Column 4, given numbers are 3,2,5.

Therefore, for Cell (0,4), possible numbers are 1,4,6,7,9

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can look for a number that must go in a specific cell in a subgrid.

Looking at Subgrid 0: Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2.

Given cell: (1,2)=9

Looking for number 1 in Subgrid 0.

Looking at the entire grid, number 1 is given in (1,8)=1 and (8,1)=5.

Wait, (1,8)=1 is in Subgrid 2.

(8,1)=5 is in Subgrid 1.

So, in Subgrid 0, 1 is not yet present.

Looking at Row 1: (1,8)=1, so 1 is in Row 1, Column 8.

Therefore, in Subgrid 0, 1 can be placed in any cell except where Column 8 intersects Row 1.

Wait, no, Subgrid 0 is Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2.

Row 1, Column 8 is outside Subgrid 0.

Therefore, in Subgrid 0, 1 can be placed in any cell where it doesn't violate the constraints.

Similarly, looking at Column 2: (1,2)=9, (2,2), (8,2)=8

So, in Subgrid 0, Column 2 has (0,2), (1,2)=9, (2,2)

Therefore, in Subgrid 0, 1 can be placed in (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), excluding (1,2)=9.

But, I need to consider the entire grid's constraints.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try a different subgrid.

Looking at Subgrid 2: Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8.

Given cells: (1,8)=1, (2,8)=4

So, in Subgrid 2, numbers 1 and 4 are present.

Therefore, missing numbers in Subgrid 2 are 2,3,5,6,7,8,9.

Looking at Row 1: (1,8)=1

Row 1's missing numbers are 2,4,5,6,7,8

Looking at Column 8: (1,8)=1, (2,8)=4, (8,8)

So, in Subgrid 2, Cell (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8)=1, (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)=4

Looking at Cell (1,7): possible numbers are 2,5,7

Looking at Cell (1,6): possible numbers are 2,6,7,8

Looking at Cell (0,8): possible numbers are 2,3,5,6,7,8,9 minus Row 0's constraints and Column 8's constraints.

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Perhaps I can look for a number that appears frequently in the grid and try to place the remaining instances of that number.

Looking at number 1:

Given cells with 1:

- (1,8)=1

- (6,5)=1

- (8,1)=5 (not 1)

Wait, (8,1)=5, not 1.

So, only (1,8)=1 and (6,5)=1.

Therefore, I need to place 1 in every row, column, and subgrid exactly once.

Looking at Row 1: has 1 in Column 8.

Row 6: has 1 in Column 5.

So, in Row 1, Column 8 has 1.

In Row 6, Column 5 has 1.

Looking at Column 5: has 1 in Row 6.

Column 8: has 1 in Row 1.

So, in Subgrid 2 (Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8), Cell (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8)=1, (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)=4

Therefore, in Subgrid 2, only Cell (1,8)=1 and (2,8)=4.

Wait, (2,8)=4, not 1.

So, in Subgrid 2, only (1,8)=1.

Therefore, in Subgrid 2, I need to place 1 in Cell (1,8)=1, and ensure no other 1s are in the same row, column, or subgrid.

Similarly, in Row 6, Column 5 has 1.

So, in Subgrid 7 (Rows 6-8, Columns 3-5), Cell (6,5)=1.

Therefore, in Subgrid 7, only Cell (6,5)=1.

Looking at number 2:

Given cells with 2:

- (4,8)=3, no, that's 3.

Wait, (5,4)=2

- (5,4)=2

- (8,5)=2

So, Row 5, Column 4=2

Row 8, Column 5=2

Therefore, in Subgrid 1 (Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5), Cell (5,4)=2 is in Row 5, which is outside Subgrid 1.

Wait, Subgrid 1 is Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5.

Row 5 is outside Subgrid 1.

So, in Subgrid 1, no given cell has 2.

Similarly, in Subgrid 7 (Rows 6-8, Columns 3-5), Cell (8,5)=2.

Therefore, in Subgrid 7, Cell (8,5)=2.

Looking at number 3:

Given cells with 3:

- (1,4)=3

- (4,8)=3

- (5,3)=3

So, in Subgrid 1 (Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5), Cell (1,4)=3.

In Subgrid 1, Row 1, Column 4=3.

In Subgrid 1, Row 5, Column 3=3.

Wait, Row 5 is outside Subgrid 1.

So, in Subgrid 1, only (1,4)=3.

Similarly, in Subgrid 2 (Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8), Cell (4,8)=3 is in Row 4, which is outside Subgrid 2.

So, in Subgrid 2, only (4,8)=3 is outside.

Wait, Subgrid 2 is Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8.

Row 4 is outside.

Therefore, in Subgrid 2, no given cell has 3.

Therefore, in Subgrid 2, 3 must be placed in one of the empty cells: (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)=4

So, possible cells for 3 in Subgrid 2 are: (0,6), (0,7), (1,6), (1,7), (2,6), (2,7)

But, considering Row and Column constraints.

This is getting too involved. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Perhaps I can look for a cell where only one number can fit due to the constraints of the row, column, and subgrid.

Looking back at Row 1: Cells (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)

Possible numbers for each:

- (1,0): 2,4,5,6,7,8

- (1,1): 2,6,7,8

- (1,3): 2,4,6,7,8

- (1,5): 4,5

- (1,6): 2,6,7,8

- (1,7): 2,5,7

Looking at Cell (1,5): only 4 and 5 are possible.

Looking at Column 5: given numbers are 8,6,7,1,2.

Therefore, possible numbers for Cell (1,5) are 4 and 5.

Looking at Subgrid 1: missing numbers are 1,2,4,5,6,7,9 minus Column 5's given numbers.

Wait, Subgrid 1 has (1,4)=3 and (2,5)=8.

So, in Subgrid 1, numbers 3 and 8 are present.

Therefore, possible numbers in Subgrid 1 are 1,2,4,5,6,7,9.

For Cell (1,5), possible numbers are 4 and 5.

Now, looking at Row 1: missing numbers are 2,4,5,6,7,8.

So, for Cell (1,5), possible numbers are 4 and 5.

Looking at Column 5: given numbers are 8,6,7,1,2.

Therefore, 4 and 5 are possible.

Looking at Subgrid 1: possible numbers are 1,2,4,5,6,7,9.

Therefore, for Cell (1,5), only 4 and 5 are possible.

Similarly, looking at Cell (1,7): possible numbers are 2,5,7.

Therefore, possible numbers for Cell (1,7) are 2,5,7.

Looking at Subgrid 2: possible numbers are 2,3,5,6,7,8,9 minus Column 7's given numbers.

So, possible: 2,5,7

Therefore, for Cell (1,7), possible numbers are 2,5,7.

Looking at Cell (1,6): possible numbers are 2,6,7,8.

Looking at Column 6: given number is 5 in Row 5.

Therefore, possible numbers for Cell (1,6) are 2,6,7,8.

Looking at Column 3: given numbers are 5,3,1.

Therefore, possible numbers for Cell (1,3) are 2,4,6,7,8.

Looking at Subgrid 0: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 minus Column 3's given numbers.

So, possible: 2,4,6,7,8

Therefore, for Cell (1,3), possible numbers are 2,4,6,7,8.

Looking at Cell (1,1): possible numbers are 2,6,7,8.

Looking at Column 1: given numbers are 4 and 5.

Therefore, possible numbers for Cell (1,1) are 2,6,7,8.

Looking at Subgrid 0: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 minus Column 1's given numbers.

So, possible: 1,2,3,6,7,8

But, considering Row 1's missing numbers: 2,4,5,6,7,8

Intersecting, possible: 2,6,7,8

Therefore, for Cell (1,1), possible numbers are 2,6,7,8.

Looking at Cell (1,0): possible numbers are 2,4,5,6,7,8.

Looking at Column 0: no given numbers.

Therefore, possible numbers for Cell (1,0) are 2,4,5,6,7,8.

Looking at Subgrid 0: possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 minus no given numbers in Column 0.

Therefore, possible: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

But, considering Row 1's missing numbers: 2,4,5,6,7,8

Therefore, for Cell (1,0), possible numbers are 2,4,5,6,7,8.

This seems too broad. Maybe I should look for a different row or column.

Let me look at Row 4: Cells (4,0), (4,1)=4, (4,2), (4,3)=5, (4,4), (4,5)=6, (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)=3

So, in Row 4, given numbers are 4,5,6,3.

Therefore, missing numbers are 1,2,7,8,9.

Looking at number 2 in Row 4: possible in Cells (4,0), (4,2), (4,6), (4,7)

Looking at number 7 in Row 4: possible in Cells (4,2), (4,4), (4,6), (4,7)

This is still too vague. Maybe I should look at another row.

Looking at Row 5: Cells (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)=3, (5,4)=2, (5,5)=7, (5,6)=5, (5,7)=6, (5,8)

So, in Row 5, given numbers are 3,2,7,5,6.

Therefore, missing numbers are 1,4,8,9.

Looking at Column 0: (5,0)

Looking at Column 1: (5,1)

Looking at Column 2: (5,2)

Looking at Column 3: (5,3)=3

Looking at Column 4: (5,4)=2

Looking at Column 5: (5,5)=7

Looking at Column 6: (5,6)=5

Looking at Column 7: (5,7)=6

Looking at Column 8: (5,8)

So, in Row 5, missing numbers are 1,4,8,9.

Looking at Cell (5,0):

- Row 5: missing 1,4,8,9

- Column 0: what's in Column 0?

Looking at Column 0:

- Row 0: empty

- Row 1: (1,0)

- Row 2: empty

- Row 3: empty

- Row 4: (4,0)

- Row 5: (5,0)

- Row 6: (6,0)

- Row 7: empty

- Row 8: (8,0)

So, in Column 0, no given numbers.

Therefore, for Cell (5,0), possible numbers are Row 5's missing numbers: 1,4,8,9

Looking at Subgrid 3: Rows 3-5, Columns 0-2.

Given cells in Subgrid 3:

- (4,1)=4

- (4,3)=5 (outside Subgrid 3)

Wait, (4,3)=5 is in Subgrid 3.

Wait, Column 3 is outside Subgrid 3.

Wait, Subgrid 3 is Rows 3-5, Columns 0-2.

So, (4,3)=5 is outside Subgrid 3.

Therefore, in Subgrid 3, given numbers are only (4,1)=4.

Therefore, missing numbers in Subgrid 3 are 1,2,6,7,8,9

For Cell (5,0), possible numbers are 1,4,8,9

Intersecting with Subgrid 3's missing numbers: 1,2,6,7,8,9

Therefore, for Cell (5,0): possible 1,8,9

Similarly, for Cell (5,1):

- Row 5: missing 1,4,8,9

- Column 1: what's in Column 1?

Looking at Column 1:

- Row 0: empty

- Row 1: (1,1)

- Row 2: empty

- Row 3: empty

- Row 4: (4,1)=4

- Row 5: (5,1)

- Row 6: empty

- Row 7: empty

- Row 8: (8,1)=5

So, in Column 1, given numbers are 4 and 5.

Therefore, for Cell (5,1), possible numbers are Row 5's missing numbers: 1,4,8,9, minus Column 1's given numbers: 4 and 5.

So, possible: 1,8,9

Looking at Subgrid 3: missing numbers are 1,2,6,7,8,9

Therefore, for Cell (5,1): possible 1,8,9

Similarly, for Cell (5,2):

- Row 5: missing 1,4,8,9

- Column 2: what's in Column 2?

Looking at Column 2:

- Row 0: empty

- Row 1: (1,2)=9

- Row 2: empty

- Row 3: empty

- Row 4: (4,2)

- Row 5: (5,2)

- Row 6: (6,2)=6

- Row 7: empty

- Row 8: (8,2)=8

So, in Column 2, given numbers are 9,6,8.

Therefore, for Cell (5,2), possible numbers are Row 5's missing numbers: 1,4,8,9, minus Column 2's given numbers: 9,6,8.

So, possible: 1,4

Looking at Subgrid 3: missing numbers are 1,2,6,7,8,9

Therefore, for Cell (5,2): possible 1,4

Similarly, for Cell (5,8):

- Row 5: missing 1,4,8,9

- Column 8: what's in Column 8?

Looking at Column 8:

- Row 0: empty

- Row 1: (1,8)=1

- Row 2: (2,8)=4

- Row 3: empty

- Row 4: (4,8)=3

- Row 5: (5,8)

- Row 6: empty

- Row 7: empty

- Row 8: empty

So, in Column 8, given numbers are 1,4,3.

Therefore, for Cell (5,8), possible numbers are Row 5's missing numbers: 1,4,8,9, minus Column 8's given numbers: 1,4,3.

So, possible: 8,9

Looking at Subgrid 5: Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8.

Given cells in Subgrid 5:

- (3,7)=8

- (5,7)=6

- (6,7)=9 (which is in Subgrid 8)

So, in Subgrid 5: (3,7)=8, (5,7)=6

Therefore, missing numbers in Subgrid 5 are 1,2,3,4,5,7,9

But, considering Row 5's missing numbers and Column 8's constraints.

Wait, Subgrid 5 is Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8.

Cell (5,8) is in Subgrid 5.

Possible numbers for Cell (5,8): 8,9

But, in Subgrid 5, given numbers are 8 and 6.

Therefore, for Cell (5,
