So I've got this problem about getting a mouse, a snake, and a piece of cheese across a river using a boat, and there are some constraints to make sure nothing gets eaten. Let's see... I'm standing on the left bank with all these items, and I need to get them all to the right bank, but the boat can only carry one thing at a time besides myself.

First, I need to understand the rules to make sure nothing gets eaten. The main issues are that the snake might eat the mouse if they're left alone together, and the mouse might eat the cheese if they're left alone together. But if I'm there with them, they won't eat each other.

So, I need to plan how to transport them one by one, making sure that at no point are the snake and mouse alone together without me, or the mouse and cheese alone together without me.

Let me think about the initial setup:

- Left Bank: me, mouse, snake, cheese, boat

- Right Bank: nothing

I need to start by taking one item across in the boat. Let's consider taking the mouse first.

Option 1: Take the mouse to the right bank.

- Left Bank: snake, cheese, boat

- Right Bank: me, mouse

But wait, if I leave the snake and cheese alone on the left bank, might they pose a problem? The problem only specifies that the snake doesn't eat the mouse and the mouse doesn't eat the cheese when left alone. So, snake and cheese alone should be fine, right?

Okay, so taking the mouse to the right bank seems safe.

Now, I need to go back to get another item. So, I go back to the left bank with the boat.

- Left Bank: me, snake, cheese, boat

- Right Bank: mouse

Now, should I take the snake next?

Option 2: Take the snake to the right bank.

- Left Bank: cheese, boat

- Right Bank: me, mouse, snake

But if I leave the mouse and cheese alone on the right bank, that could be a problem because the mouse might eat the cheese. So, that's not good. I need to make sure that whenever I'm not there, the mouse and cheese are not alone together.

Therefore, taking the snake to the right bank is not a good idea at this point because it would leave the mouse and cheese alone on the right bank.

Alternative option: Take the cheese to the right bank instead.

Option 3: Take the cheese to the right bank.

- Left Bank: snake, boat

- Right Bank: me, mouse, cheese

Now, on the right bank, I have myself, the mouse, and the cheese. Since I'm there, the mouse won't eat the cheese. On the left bank, only the snake is there alone, which is fine.

Now, I need to go back to get the snake.

- Left Bank: me, snake, boat

- Right Bank: mouse, cheese

Taking the snake to the right bank now should be safe because I'll be there with them, so the snake won't eat the mouse.

- Left Bank: boat

- Right Bank: me, mouse, snake, cheese

But wait, I need to make sure that when I take the snake to the right bank, I don't leave anyone behind who might cause problems. In this case, on the right bank, I'll have myself, mouse, snake, and cheese together, which should be fine because I'm present.

So, seems like this could work.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Take the mouse to the right bank.

2. Return alone to the left bank.

3. Take the cheese to the right bank.

4. Return alone to the left bank.

5. Take the snake to the right bank.

That seems straightforward, but I should double-check if there are any scenarios where the constraints are violated.

Let's simulate it step by step:

- Start: Left Bank - me, mouse, snake, cheese, boat; Right Bank - nothing

- Step 1: Take mouse to right bank.

- Left Bank - snake, cheese, boat; Right Bank - me, mouse

- Is there any problem here? Snake and cheese are alone on the left bank, but they don't eat each other, so it's fine.

- Step 2: Return alone to left bank.

- Left Bank - me, snake, cheese, boat; Right Bank - mouse

- No issues here.

- Step 3: Take cheese to right bank.

- Left Bank - snake, boat; Right Bank - me, mouse, cheese

- On right bank, I'm with mouse and cheese, so mouse won't eat cheese.

- On left bank, only snake is alone, which is fine.

- Step 4: Return alone to left bank.

- Left Bank - me, snake, boat; Right Bank - mouse, cheese

- No issues.

- Step 5: Take snake to right bank.

- Left Bank - boat; Right Bank - me, mouse, snake, cheese

- Everyone is together with me, so no problems.

Looks good! But maybe there's another way to do it, or perhaps a more efficient method.

Let's consider taking the snake first.

Option 4: Take the snake to the right bank.

- Left Bank: mouse, cheese, boat; Right Bank: me, snake

- Here, on the left bank, mouse and cheese are alone, which could lead to the mouse eating the cheese.

That's a problem. So, taking the snake first is not a good idea.

Another option: Take the cheese first.

Option 5: Take the cheese to the right bank.

- Left Bank: mouse, snake, boat; Right Bank: me, cheese

- On left bank, mouse and snake are alone, which could lead to the snake eating the mouse.

That's bad. So, taking the cheese first in this scenario also leads to problems.

Therefore, the initial plan of taking the mouse first seems to be the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can take the mouse to the right bank, then go back and take the snake, but bring the mouse back with me to get the cheese.

Wait, let's explore that.

Option 6:

1. Take mouse to right bank.

2. Return alone to left bank.

3. Take snake to right bank.

4. Now, on right bank: me, mouse, snake; left bank: cheese, boat

- But if I leave the mouse and snake alone on the right bank while I go back for the cheese, that could be a problem because the snake might eat the mouse.

No, because I'm there with them, but if I leave them alone, that's when the problem occurs.

So, if I take the snake to the right bank and then return alone, leaving mouse and snake alone on the right bank, that's a problem.

Therefore, this approach won't work.

So, back to the initial plan:

1. Take mouse to right bank.

2. Return alone to left bank.

3. Take cheese to right bank.

4. Return alone to left bank.

5. Take snake to right bank.

This seems to be the safest and most straightforward way to get everything across without any issues.

I don't think there's a way to do it more efficiently, given the constraints of the boat's capacity and the interactions between the items.

Therefore, the plan is:

- Take mouse to right bank.

- Return alone.

- Take cheese to right bank.

- Return alone.

- Take snake to right bank.

That should do it.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Take the mouse to the right bank, then the cheese, and finally the snake, ensuring no two items are left alone together in a way that one could eat the other.}} \]
