Reasoned for a couple of seconds
I’m analyzing the snake, mouse, and cheese puzzle. Starting with the mouse, then returning empty. If I take the snake next, I risk leaving the mouse behind with it on the right bank. But if the human stays with one during each crossing, things might work out. Still, I think transporting the mouse first is the safer option, then coming back to fetch either the snake or cheese. The key is making sure the human supervises any dangerous pair left behind. A tricky puzzle!

Here's one step-by-step plan that satisfies all constraints:

Take the mouse to the right bank.
Left bank: snake, cheese
Right bank: mouse, boat

Return with the boat empty.
Left bank: snake, cheese, boat
Right bank: mouse

Take the snake to the right bank.
Left bank: cheese
Right bank: snake, mouse, boat
(Note: With you present, the snake won’t eat the mouse during transit.)

Bring the mouse back to the left bank.
Left bank: mouse, cheese, boat
Right bank: snake
(This avoids leaving the snake and mouse alone together.)

Take the cheese to the right bank.
Left bank: mouse
Right bank: snake, cheese, boat
(The snake and cheese are safe together.)

Return with the boat empty.
Left bank: mouse, boat
Right bank: snake, cheese

Finally, take the mouse to the right bank.
Left bank: —
Right bank: snake, mouse, cheese, boat

This plan ensures that at no point are the snake and mouse or the mouse and cheese left alone together without your supervision.
