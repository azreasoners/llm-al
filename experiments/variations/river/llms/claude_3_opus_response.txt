Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. To get the mouse, snake, and cheese across the river while ensuring that the snake doesn't eat the mouse and the mouse doesn't eat the cheese, we need to find a sequence of actions that will transport them safely to the RightBank.

Here's a plan to achieve this:

Take the mouse in the boat from LeftBank to RightBank.
Return to LeftBank with an empty boat.
Take the cheese in the boat from LeftBank to RightBank.
Take the mouse back to LeftBank in the boat.
Leave the mouse on LeftBank and take the snake in the boat to RightBank.
Return to LeftBank with an empty boat.
Take the mouse in the boat from LeftBank to RightBank.
Now, let's review the steps and the positions of the mouse, snake, and cheese after each step:

Initial state:

LeftBank: mouse, snake, cheese
RightBank: (empty)
After step 1:

LeftBank: snake, cheese
RightBank: mouse
After step 2:

LeftBank: snake, cheese
RightBank: mouse
After step 3:

LeftBank: snake
RightBank: mouse, cheese
After step 4:

LeftBank: snake, mouse
RightBank: cheese
After step 5:

LeftBank: mouse
RightBank: snake, cheese
After step 6:

LeftBank: mouse
RightBank: snake, cheese
After step 7:

LeftBank: (empty)
RightBank: mouse, snake, cheese
By following this plan, you can safely transport the mouse, snake, and cheese from LeftBank to RightBank without the snake eating the mouse or the mouse eating the cheese.
