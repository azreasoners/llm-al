Thought about river crossing puzzle for 13 seconds
Mapping the puzzle

OK, let’s answer the classic puzzle: a boat, a mouse, a snake, and cheese. Only one item fits in the boat each trip. The snake will gobble the mouse if left alone together, while the mouse will eat the cheese if left together.

Verifying safety

First, bring the mouse to the right bank, ensuring the snake stays with cheese on the left. Then, return alone and safely transport the snake next.

Ensuring safety

I’m piecing together the sequence: mouse to right bank, return solo, cheese to right bank, return alone, then mouse again to right bank. No conflicts since the snake doesn't snack on cheese.

Ensuring safety

Thinking through the scenario, it seems having both mouse and snake on the right bank, with a human present, prevents any conflicts.ाहरण

Ensuring safety

Taking over from the left bank to the right bank, keeping the mouse, snake, and myself together ensures no conflicts. The cheese stays on the left bank with the boat.

Ensuring optimal safety

OK, let me see. The mouse and snake are switched right bank to left bank. This keeps the snake and cheese together safely.

Taking a closer look

Returning the mouse alone back to the left bank with the cheese, while the snake remains on the right bank, raises concerns since actively preventing the mouse and cheese from being left together is not feasible.

Weighing options

OK, let me see. Carrying either the cheese or the mouse next trip means leaving others behind, risking potential eating conflicts, as the puzzle necessitates leaving one behind each time.

Quick thoughts

OK, I’m piecing together a strategy: frequently moving the mouse to the right bank ensures no conflicts arise, while the snake and cheese stay separated on the left bank.

Below is a classic step-by-step solution. The key insight is that you can never leave the “predator–prey” pairs alone (snake–mouse, or mouse–cheese), but you can leave snake–cheese alone, since they do not harm each other. You can only ferry one item at a time, and your presence prevents them from eating one another while you are all on the same side.

Notation

L = LeftBank
R = RightBank
S = Snake
M = Mouse
C = Cheese
Boat moves are shown as:
(Thing): you transport that thing in the boat
( ): you cross empty
Initially:

L: S, M, C, (you + boat)
R: —
Step-by-step Plan
Take the Mouse across first

Move M from L to R.
L: S, C
R: M
Return empty

Go back alone.
L: S, C, (you + boat)
R: M
Take the Snake across

Move S from L to R.
But you cannot leave S and M alone on R.
So you drop S on R, then immediately pick M back up into the boat.
L: C
R: S
Boat (with you) is about to return with M.
Bring the Mouse back

Move M from R back to L.
L: M, C
R: S
Take the Cheese across

Move C from L to R.
L: M
R: S, C
Return empty again

Go back alone to pick up the Mouse.
L: M, (you + boat)
R: S, C
Finally, bring the Mouse across

Move M from L to R.
L: —
R: S, M, C
At the end, all three items (Snake, Mouse, Cheese) are safely on the RightBank, and you have avoided leaving the dangerous pairs (snake–mouse, mouse–cheese) alone without your supervision.
