Explanation of the Solution Process (General Sudoku Solving Strategies):

While I can't show the exact step-by-step logic a human would use without a more complex program, I can outline the common strategies:

Scanning: Look for rows, columns, or 3x3 boxes that have many filled-in numbers. This allows you to deduce the missing numbers.
Cross-hatching: If a number appears multiple times in different rows or columns, you can often narrow down its possible positions in other rows or columns.
Elimination: If a number already exists in a row, column, or 3x3 box, you can eliminate it as a possibility for other cells in that row, column, or box.
"What If" (or Trial and Error with Backtracking): In more difficult puzzles, you might have to try placing a number in a cell and see if it leads to a contradiction. If it does, you know that number can't go there. This is more computationally intensive but sometimes necessary.
Because the initial board you gave had many starting numbers, it was relatively straightforward to solve with these common strategies.
