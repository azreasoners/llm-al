So I have this Sudoku puzzle to solve. I've never really done Sudoku before, but I've heard it's about filling a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, following some rules. The rules are that no two numbers in the same row can be the same, no two numbers in the same column can be the same, and no two numbers in each 3x3 subgrid can be the same. Alright, let's see.

First, I need to understand the grid. It's a 9x9 grid, which means there are 81 cells in total. These are divided into 9 rows and 9 columns, and also into 9 smaller 3x3 grids. The 3x3 grids are formed by dividing the big grid into three rows of three grids each.

Now, some cells already have numbers in them, and I need to fill in the rest. The given cells are:

- Row 0, Column 2: 4

- Row 0, Column 3: 3

- Row 0, Column 6: 2

- Row 0, Column 8: 9

- Row 1, Column 2: 5

- Row 1, Column 5: 9

- Row 1, Column 8: 1

- Row 2, Column 1: 7

- Row 2, Column 4: 6

- Row 2, Column 7: 4

- Row 2, Column 8: 3

- Row 3, Column 2: 6

- Row 3, Column 5: 2

- Row 3, Column 7: 8

- Row 3, Column 8: 7

- Row 4, Column 0: 1

- Row 4, Column 1: 9

- Row 4, Column 5: 7

- Row 4, Column 6: 4

- Row 5, Column 1: 5

- Row 5, Column 4: 8

- Row 5, Column 5: 3

- Row 6, Column 0: 6

- Row 6, Column 6: 1

- Row 6, Column 8: 5

- Row 7, Column 2: 3

- Row 7, Column 3: 5

- Row 7, Column 5: 8

- Row 7, Column 6: 6

- Row 7, Column 7: 9

- Row 8, Column 1: 4

- Row 8, Column 2: 2

- Row 8, Column 3: 9

- Row 8, Column 4: 1

- Row 8, Column 6: 3

Alright, that's a lot of given numbers. I need to make sure I place the remaining numbers correctly without violating any of the Sudoku rules.

Maybe I should start by understanding the 3x3 subgrids. Let's see:

The 9 subgrids are:

1. Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2

2. Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5

3. Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8

4. Rows 3-5, Columns 0-2

5. Rows 3-5, Columns 3-5

6. Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8

7. Rows 6-8, Columns 0-2

8. Rows 6-8, Columns 3-5

9. Rows 6-8, Columns 6-8

I need to make sure that in each of these subgrids, the numbers 1 through 9 are used without repetition.

Also, in each row and each column, numbers 1 through 9 must be used without repetition.

So, my task is to fill in the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that no row, column, or 3x3 subgrid has duplicate numbers.

I think the best way to approach this is to look for cells where only one number can fit based on the existing numbers in the row, column, and subgrid.

Let me try to visualize the grid. Since I can't actually see the grid, I'll have to imagine it based on the given coordinates.

Let's list out the given cells:

Row 0:

- Column 2: 4

- Column 3: 3

- Column 6: 2

- Column 8: 9

Row 1:

- Column 2: 5

- Column 5: 9

- Column 8: 1

Row 2:

- Column 1: 7

- Column 4: 6

- Column 7: 4

- Column 8: 3

Row 3:

- Column 2: 6

- Column 5: 2

- Column 7: 8

- Column 8: 7

Row 4:

- Column 0: 1

- Column 1: 9

- Column 5: 7

- Column 6: 4

Row 5:

- Column 1: 5

- Column 4: 8

- Column 5: 3

Row 6:

- Column 0: 6

- Column 6: 1

- Column 8: 5

Row 7:

- Column 2: 3

- Column 3: 5

- Column 5: 8

- Column 6: 6

- Column 7: 9

Row 8:

- Column 1: 4

- Column 2: 2

- Column 3: 9

- Column 4: 1

- Column 6: 3

Alright, now I need to find a way to figure out which numbers go into the empty cells.

Maybe I should start by looking at row 0. What numbers are missing in row 0?

Row 0 has columns 2,3,6,8 filled: 4,3,2,9

So the numbers present are 2,3,4,9.

The missing numbers are 1,5,6,7,8.

But I need to see where these can fit without conflicting with the columns and subgrids.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the subgrids as well.

Let's consider the subgrids.

Subgrid 1: Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2.

Given cells:

- Row 0, Column 2: 4

- Row 2, Column 1: 7

So in subgrid 1, we have cells (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).

We know:

- (0,2): 4

- (2,1): 7

So, in subgrid 1, numbers 4 and 7 are already used.

Therefore, the remaining numbers for subgrid 1 are 1,2,3,5,6,8,9.

But I need to consider the rows and columns as well.

Wait, maybe I should try a different approach.

Perhaps I should look for cells where only one number can fit.

Let's try that.

Let's look at row 0, column 0.

Is there a number that can only go there?

Wait, I need to check what numbers are already in row 0, column 0's row, column, and subgrid.

Wait, row 0 already has 4,3,2,9 in columns 2,3,6,8.

So, in row 0, columns 0,1,4,5,7 are empty.

Let me try to fill in row 0.

Row 0 needs numbers 1,5,6,7,8.

Let's see column 0.

Column 0 has:

- Row 0: empty

- Row 1: empty

- Row 2: empty

- Row 3: empty

- Row 4: 1

- Row 5: empty

- Row 6: 6

- Row 7: empty

- Row 8: empty

So, in column 0, the numbers 1 and 6 are already used (row 4:1, row 6:6).

Therefore, possible numbers for row 0, column 0 are 1,5,6,7,8 minus 1 and 6, so 5,7,8.

But I need to check the subgrid as well.

Subgrid 1 (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) has numbers 4 and 7 already.

Wait, row 0, column 0 is in subgrid 1.

Subgrid 1 has:

- Row 0, column 0: ?

- Row 0, column 1: ?

- Row 0, column 2: 4

- Row 1, column 0: ?

- Row 1, column 1: ?

- Row 1, column 2: 5

- Row 2, column 0: ?

- Row 2, column 1: 7

- Row 2, column 2: ?

So, in subgrid 1, numbers 4 and 7 are used.

Therefore, in row 0, column 0, possible numbers are 1,2,3,5,6,8,9 minus 4 and 7, and minus column 0's 1 and 6.

Wait, but column 0 only has 1 and 6 from rows 4 and 6.

So, for row 0, column 0, possible numbers are 5,7,8 minus 7 (from subgrid), so 5 and 8.

But wait, subgrid already has 4 and 7, so 5,6,8 are possible, but column has 1 and 6, so 5 and 8 are possible.

So, row 0, column 0 can be either 5 or 8.

Similarly, row 0, column 1.

Row 0 needs: 1,5,6,7,8

Column 1:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: 9

- Row 5: 5

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: ?

- Row 8: 4

So, in column 1, numbers 4,5,9 are used.

Therefore, possible for row 0, column 1: 1,5,6,7,8 minus 5 (from column), so 1,6,7,8.

Subgrid 1 has 4 and 7, so possible are 1,2,3,5,6,8,9 minus 4 and 7, so 1,2,3,5,6,8,9.

But column 1 has 4,5,9, so for row 0, column 1: 1,2,3,6,8.

But row 0 needs 1,5,6,7,8, but intersecting with subgrid and column, possible are 1,6,8.

So, row 0, column 1 can be 1,6,8.

Wait, but row 0 needs 1,5,6,7,8, but 5 is excluded by column 1.

So, possible for row 0, column 1: 1,6,8.

Similarly, row 0, column 4.

Row 0 needs 1,5,6,7,8.

Column 4:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: 6

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: 6

- Row 5: 8

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: ?

- Row 8: 1

So, in column 4, numbers 1,6,8 are used.

Therefore, possible for row 0, column 4: 1,5,6,7,8 minus 1,6,8, so only 5 and 7.

Subgrid 3 (rows 0-2, columns 6-8):

Wait, no, column 4 is in subgrid 2 (rows 0-2, columns 3-5).

Wait, hold on.

Subgrids are:

1. Rows 0-2, Columns 0-2

2. Rows 0-2, Columns 3-5

3. Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8

4. Rows 3-5, Columns 0-2

5. Rows 3-5, Columns 3-5

6. Rows 3-5, Columns 6-8

7. Rows 6-8, Columns 0-2

8. Rows 6-8, Columns 3-5

9. Rows 6-8, Columns 6-8

So, column 4 is in subgrid 2 (rows 0-2, columns 3-5).

Subgrid 2 has:

- Row 0, column 3: 3

- Row 0, column 4: ?

- Row 0, column 5: ?

- Row 1, column 3: ?

- Row 1, column 4: ?

- Row 1, column 5: 9

- Row 2, column 3: ?

- Row 2, column 4: 6

- Row 2, column 5: ?

So, in subgrid 2, numbers 3 and 9 are used.

Therefore, possible numbers for row 0, column 4 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 minus 3 and 9 (from subgrid) and minus 1,6,8 (from column 4), and also minus row 0's 2,3,4,9.

Wait, row 0 already has 2,3,4,9.

So, row 0, column 4 can only be 1,5,6,7,8 minus the used numbers in column 4 (1,6,8) and subgrid 2 (3,9).

So, possible numbers are 5 and 7.

Hmm, seems like row 0, column 4 can only be 5 or 7.

Similarly, row 0, column 5.

Row 0 needs 1,5,6,7,8.

Column 5:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: 9

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: 2

- Row 4: 7

- Row 5: 3

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: 8

- Row 8: ?

So, in column 5, numbers 2,3,7,8,9 are used.

Therefore, possible for row 0, column 5: 1,5,6,7,8 minus 2,3,7,8,9, which leaves 1 and 5.

Subgrid 2 has 3 and 9.

So, possible numbers for row 0, column 5 are 1 and 5.

But row 0 needs 1,5,6,7,8, and column 5 has 2,3,7,8,9, so 1 and 5 are possible.

Wait, but subgrid 2 has 3 and 9, so possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 minus 3 and 9, which is 1,2,4,5,6,7,8.

Intersecting with row 0's needed numbers and column 5's available numbers, it's 1 and 5.

So, row 0, column 5 can be 1 or 5.

Similarly, row 0, column 7.

Row 0 needs 1,5,6,7,8.

Column 7:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: 4

- Row 3: 8

- Row 4: ?

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: 9

- Row 8: ?

So, in column 7, numbers 4,8,9 are used.

Therefore, possible for row 0, column 7: 1,5,6,7,8 minus 4,8,9, which is 1,5,6,7.

Subgrid 3 (rows 0-2, columns 6-8):

- Row 0, column 6: 2

- Row 0, column 7: ?

- Row 0, column 8: 9

- Row 1, column 6: ?

- Row 1, column 7: ?

- Row 1, column 8: 1

- Row 2, column 6: ?

- Row 2, column 7: 4

- Row 2, column 8: 3

So, in subgrid 3, numbers 1,2,3,4,9 are used.

Therefore, possible numbers for row 0, column 7 are 1,5,6,7 minus 1,2,3,4,9, which leaves 5,6,7.

But earlier, from column 7, possible are 1,5,6,7.

Intersecting, possible numbers for row 0, column 7 are 5,6,7.

Hmm.

So, for row 0, column 7, possible numbers are 5,6,7.

Similarly, let's look at row 1, column 0.

Row 1 needs numbers that are not in row 1.

Row 1 has:

- Column 2: 5

- Column 5: 9

- Column 8: 1

So, row 1 has 5,9,1.

Therefore, row 1 needs 2,3,4,6,7,8.

Column 0:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: 1

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: 6

- Row 7: ?

- Row 8: ?

So, in column 0, numbers 1 and 6 are used.

Subgrid 1 (rows 0-2, columns 0-2):

Has numbers 4 and 7.

Therefore, possible for row 1, column 0: 2,3,4,6,7,8 minus 4 and 7 (from subgrid) and minus 1 and 6 (from column), which leaves 2,3,8.

So, row 1, column 0 can be 2,3,8.

Similarly, row 1, column 1.

Row 1 needs 2,3,4,6,7,8.

Column 1:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: 9

- Row 5: 5

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: ?

- Row 8: 4

So, in column 1, numbers 4,5,9 are used.

Therefore, possible for row 1, column 1: 2,3,6,7,8 minus 5 and 9 and 4, which is 2,3,6,7,8.

Subgrid 1 has 4 and 7.

So, possible numbers are 1,2,3,5,6,8,9 minus 4 and 7, and minus column 1's 4,5,9, which leaves 1,2,3,6,8.

But row 1 needs 2,3,4,6,7,8, so intersecting, possible numbers are 2,3,6,8.

Similarly, row 1, column 3.

Row 1 needs 2,3,4,6,7,8.

Column 3:

- Row 0: 3

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: ?

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: 5

- Row 8: 9

So, in column 3, numbers 3,5,9 are used.

Therefore, possible for row 1, column 3: 2,3,4,6,7,8 minus 3,5,9, which is 2,4,6,7,8.

Subgrid 2 has 3 and 9.

So, possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 minus 3 and 9, which is 1,2,4,5,6,7,8.

Intersecting with row 1's needed numbers and column 3's available numbers, possible are 2,4,6,7,8.

Similarly, row 1, column 4.

Row 1 needs 2,3,4,6,7,8.

Column 4:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: 6

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: 6

- Row 5: 8

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: ?

- Row 8: 1

So, in column 4, numbers 1,6,8 are used.

Therefore, possible for row 1, column 4: 2,3,4,6,7,8 minus 1,6,8, which is 2,3,4,7.

Subgrid 2 has 3 and 9.

So, possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 minus 3 and 9, which is 1,2,4,5,6,7,8.

Intersecting with row 1's needed numbers and column 4's available numbers, possible are 2,4,7.

Similarly, row 1, column 6.

Row 1 needs 2,3,4,6,7,8.

Column 6:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: 4

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: 1

- Row 7: 6

- Row 8: ?

So, in column 6, numbers 1,4,6 are used.

Therefore, possible for row 1, column 6: 2,3,4,6,7,8 minus 1,4,6, which is 2,3,7,8.

Subgrid 3 has 1,2,3,4,9.

Wait, subgrid 3 (rows 0-2, columns 6-8):

- Row 0, column 6: 2

- Row 0, column 7: ?

- Row 0, column 8: 9

- Row 1, column 6: ?

- Row 1, column 7: ?

- Row 1, column 8: 1

- Row 2, column 6: ?

- Row 2, column 7: 4

- Row 2, column 8: 3

So, in subgrid 3, numbers 1,2,3,4,9 are used.

Therefore, possible numbers for row 1, column 6 are 2,3,7,8 minus 1,2,3,4,9, which leaves 7 and 8.

So, row 1, column 6 can be 7 or 8.

Similarly, row 1, column 7.

Row 1 needs 2,3,4,6,7,8.

Column 7:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: 4

- Row 3: 8

- Row 4: ?

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: 9

- Row 8: ?

So, in column 7, numbers 4,8,9 are used.

Therefore, possible for row 1, column 7: 2,3,6,7,8 minus 4,8,9, which is 2,3,6,7.

Subgrid 3 has 1,2,3,4,9.

So, possible numbers are 2,3,6,7 minus 1,2,3,4,9, which leaves 6 and 7.

Therefore, row 1, column 7 can be 6 or 7.

Alright, so for row 1, column 6 and row 1, column 7, possible numbers are 7 and 8 for column 6, and 6 and 7 for column 7.

This seems like a pair where 7 could be in either column, but 8 is only possible in column 6, and 6 is only possible in column 7.

Wait, actually, in column 6, possible are 7 and 8, and in column 7, possible are 6 and 7.

So, if I place 8 in column 6, then column 7 must be 7, and column 6 is 8.

Alternatively, if column 6 is 7, then column 7 must be 6.

So, in row 1, column 6 and 7, it's either 7 and 6, or 8 and 7.

But I need to see if I can determine which one is which.

Looking back at row 1's needed numbers: 2,3,4,6,7,8.

If I place 8 in column 6 and 7 in column 7, then row 1 has 8 and 7.

The remaining numbers are 2,3,4,6.

Looking at other columns:

Column 0: possible 2,3,8

Column 1: possible 2,3,6,8

Column 3: possible 2,4,6,7,8

Column 4: possible 2,4,7

So, if I place 8 in column 6, then column 0 could have 2 or 3, column 1 could have 2,3,6,8, column 3 could have 2,4,6,7,8, column 4 could have 2,4,7.

This seems too vague to decide right now.

Alternatively, maybe I should look at another row.

Let's look at row 2.

Row 2 has:

- Column 1: 7

- Column 4: 6

- Column 7: 4

- Column 8: 3

So, row 2 has numbers 3,4,6,7.

Therefore, row 2 needs numbers 1,2,5,8,9.

Column 0:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: 1

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: 6

- Row 7: ?

- Row 8: ?

So, in column 0, numbers 1 and 6 are used.

Therefore, possible for row 2, column 0: 1,2,5,8,9 minus 1 and 6, which is 2,5,8,9.

Subgrid 1 has 4 and 7.

So, possible numbers are 1,2,3,5,6,8,9 minus 4 and 7, and minus column 0's 1 and 6, which leaves 2,3,5,8,9.

Intersecting with row 2's needed numbers, possible are 2,5,8,9.

Similarly, row 2, column 2.

Row 2 needs 1,2,5,8,9.

Column 2:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: 5

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: 6

- Row 4: ?

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: 3

- Row 8: 2

So, in column 2, numbers 2,3,5,6 are used.

Therefore, possible for row 2, column 2: 1,2,5,8,9 minus 2,3,5,6, which leaves 1,8,9.

Subgrid 1 has 4 and 7.

So, possible numbers are 1,2,3,5,6,8,9 minus 4 and 7, and minus column 2's 2,3,5,6, which leaves 1,8,9.

Therefore, row 2, column 2 can be 1,8,9.

Similarly, row 2, column 3.

Row 2 needs 1,2,5,8,9.

Column 3:

- Row 0: 3

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: ?

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: 5

- Row 8: 9

So, in column 3, numbers 3,5,9 are used.

Therefore, possible for row 2, column 3: 1,2,5,8,9 minus 3,5,9, which is 1,2,8.

Subgrid 2 has 3 and 9.

So, possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 minus 3 and 9, which is 1,2,4,5,6,7,8.

Intersecting with row 2's needed numbers and column 3's available numbers, possible are 1,2,8.

Similarly, row 2, column 5.

Row 2 needs 1,2,5,8,9.

Column 5:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: 9

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: 2

- Row 4: 7

- Row 5: 3

- Row 6: ?

- Row 7: 8

- Row 8: ?

So, in column 5, numbers 2,3,7,8,9 are used.

Therefore, possible for row 2, column 5: 1,2,5,8,9 minus 2,3,7,8,9, which leaves 1 and 5.

Subgrid 2 has 3 and 9.

So, possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 minus 3 and 9, which is 1,2,4,5,6,7,8.

Intersecting with row 2's needed numbers and column 5's available numbers, possible are 1 and 5.

Similarly, row 2, column 6.

Row 2 needs 1,2,5,8,9.

Column 6:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: 4

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: 1

- Row 7: 6

- Row 8: ?

So, in column 6, numbers 1,4,6 are used.

Therefore, possible for row 2, column 6: 1,2,5,8,9 minus 1,4,6, which is 2,5,8,9.

Subgrid 3 has 1,2,3,4,9.

So, possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 minus 1,2,3,4,9, which leaves 5,6,7,8.

But row 2 needs 1,2,5,8,9, and column 6 has 1,4,6.

Intersecting, possible numbers are 5 and 8.

Wait, subgrid 3 has 1,2,3,4,9, and column 6 has 1,4,6.

So, possible numbers for row 2, column 6 are 5 and 8.

Similarly, row 2, column 8 is already 3.

Alright, so for row 2, column 6, possible numbers are 5 and 8.

Looking back, row 2 needs 1,2,5,8,9.

Columns:

- Column 0: 2,5,8,9

- Column 2: 1,8,9

- Column 3: 1,2,8

- Column 5: 1,5

- Column 6: 5,8

- Column 8: 3 (already filled)

So, possible numbers for row 2 are spread across these columns.

This seems a bit tricky to make progress here.

Maybe I should look at another row.

Let's look at row 3.

Row 3 has:

- Column 2: 6

- Column 5: 2

- Column 7: 8

- Column 8: 7

So, row 3 has numbers 2,6,7,8.

Therefore, row 3 needs numbers 1,3,4,5,9.

Column 0:

- Row 0: ?

- Row 1: ?

- Row 2: ?

- Row 3: ?

- Row 4: 1

- Row 5: ?

- Row 6: 6

- Row 7: ?

Subgrid 4 has 1,5,6,9.

So, possible numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 minus 1,5,6,9, which is 2,3,4,7,8.

Intersecting with row 3's needed numbers and column 1's available numbers, possible are 1 and 3.

But subgrid 4 has 1,5,6,9, and column 1 has 4,5,9, so possible are 1,2,3,4,7,8.

But row 3 needs 1,3,4,5,9, so intersecting, possible are 1 and 3.

Similarly, row 3, column 4.

Therefore, possible numbers for row 3, column 6 are 1,3,4,5,9 minus 4,7,8, which is 1,3,5,9.

Intersecting with row 3's needed numbers and column 6's available numbers, possible are 3,5,9.

Wait, but earlier I had 3,5,9 minus column 6's 1,4,6, which leaves 3,5,9.

But subgrid 6 has 4,7,8.

So, possible numbers are 1,2,3,5,6,9 minus 4,7,8, which is 1,2,3,5,6,9.
