2. Solve it logically (key steps)
Rather than show every pencil‐marking, here is an outline of major logical discoveries. (Sudoku can be solved in many different orders; the sequence below is one consistent path.)

Look at Row 4, Column 2.

Row 4 has digits 
{
1

9
,
7
,
4
}
{1,9,7,4} already; it is missing 
{

}
{2,3,5,6,8}.
Column 2 already has

…
 
}
{4,5,6,3,2,…}. Checking carefully shows

𝑅

R4C2.
Use box‐constraints to keep narrowing cells. For instance, in the middle‐left 
3
×
3
3×3 box (rows 3–5, cols 0–2), one can deduce 
𝑅
5
𝐶

𝐶

=

R6C2=9, then 
𝑅

𝐶

R2C2=1, and so on.

Continue row by row or column by column to place singles:

You find 
𝑅
2
𝐶
5

R2C5=5.
Then row 2 becomes almost complete, etc.
In the top‐left box, deduce 
𝑅

𝐶

=
8
R0C0=8 (rather than 6, which would conflict with the given 
𝑅

𝐶
0

R6C0=6 in the same column).
Proceed similarly to fill in further cells.
Fill in forced values when a row’s (or column’s) “missing digits” set intersects with a column’s (or row’s) “missing digits” set or with the box “missing digits” set down to a single possibility.

As you keep iterating these logical steps, each row/column/box gets completed.

Eventually, you arrive at the fully‐solved grid:
