Absolutely! Here's how to approach and solve your Sudoku puzzle, including the necessary techniques to get the solution.

Understanding Sudoku

Rules: You've described them perfectly. Each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid must contain all digits 1-9 without duplicates.
Difficulty: The difficulty of a Sudoku puzzle depends on the number of pre-filled numbers and their placement.
How to Solve

Here's a breakdown of techniques, going from basic to more advanced

Scanning:

Look for rows, columns, or 3x3 sub-grids that have only one empty cell. That missing number is obvious.
Scan rows, columns, and sub-grids for a specific number and see where it can potentially go.
Pencil Marks (Candidates):

In empty cells, lightly write in small numbers (candidates) that could possibly go in that cell based on the existing numbers.
As you fill in more numbers, eliminate candidates.
Hidden Singles:

When a particular number can only fit in one cell within a row, column, or sub-grid, that's a hidden single.
Naked Pairs, Triples, etc.:

If two cells in a unit (row, column, sub-grid) can only contain the same two numbers, those numbers can be eliminated as candidates from other cells in that unit. This principle extends to triples and larger sets.
