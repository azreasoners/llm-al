We've got the problem: solve a Sudoku puzzle with the given clues in plain text. First, let me organize the clues into a 9x9 board format for clarity. Rows are indexed 0 to 8, columns 0 to 8. I'll start by listing known clues:

Row 0: col2=4, col3=3, col6=2, col8=9

Row 1: col2=5, col5=9, col8=1

Row 2: col1=7, col4=6, col7=4, col8=3

Row 3: col2=6, col5=2, col7=8, col8=7

Row 4: col0=1, col1=9, col5=7, col6=4

Row 5: col1=5, col4=8, col5=3

Row 6: col0=6, col6=1, col8=5

Row 7: col2=3, col3=5, col5=8, col6=6, col7=9

Row 8: col1=4, col2=2, col3=9, col4=1, col6=3

Time to fill in the blanks!

I'm organizing the puzzle as a grid, where each row and column has some known and some missing numbers. I'll break down the missing digits for each row, like:

Row 0: missing {1,5,6,7,8}.

Row 1: missing {2,3,4,6,7,8}.

Row 2: missing {1,2,5,8,9}.

After this, I'll focus on columns. For example, column 0 has known numbers in rows 4 and 6 (1 and 6), leaving many missing digits. This step-by-step process should help solve it systematically!

I’m analyzing the puzzle by looking at intersections and missing digits. For example, row 2 has missing numbers {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}. For certain cells (like r2c0 and r2c2), intersection logic helps narrow down possibilities. I’m filling in cells like r2c0 as {2, 8, 9} based on row and square constraints. Similarly, r2c2 is {1, 8, 9}. For r2c3 and r2c5, I also use intersections to limit options like {1, 2, 8} and {1, 5}. Step-by-step, this will lead me toward a full solution.

The final solved Sudoku grid is:

diff
Copy
8 6 4 | 3 7 1 | 2 5 9
3 2 5 | 8 4 9 | 7 6 1
9 7 1 | 2 6 5 | 8 4 3
------+------+------
4 3 6 | 1 9 2 | 5 8 7
1 9 8 | 6 5 7 | 4 3 2
2 5 7 | 4 8 3 | 9 1 6
------+------+------
6 8 9 | 7 3 4 | 1 2 5
7 1 3 | 5 2 8 | 6 9 4
5 4 2 | 9 1 6 | 3 7 8
Each row, column, and 3×3 square contains exactly the digits 1 through 9.
