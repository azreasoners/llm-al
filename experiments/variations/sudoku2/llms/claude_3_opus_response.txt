Here is the complete solution to the Sudoku puzzle:

5 1 3 | 2 0 7 | 6 4 8
0 7 4 | 6 8 3 | 5 2 1
2 6 8 | 1 5 4 | 7 3 0
-----+-----+-----
7 0 5 | 3 2 1 | 8 6 4
1 8 0 | 4 6 5 | 3 7 2
3 4 2 | 8 7 0 | 1 5 6
-----+-----+-----
5 2 6 | 7 1 8 | 0 3 4
8 3 1 | 0 4 2 | 5 6 7
4 5 7 | 0 3 6 | 2 1 8

To explain the reasoning:

Fill in the given numbers from the problem statement in their respective positions.
Look for a row, column, or 3x3 square where only one number is missing. Fill in that number.
Repeatedly apply the following strategies until the puzzle is solved: a. Scanning rows: For each missing number in a row, check the columns and 3x3 square it belongs to. If the number can only fit in one cell, fill it in. b. Scanning columns: For each missing number in a column, check the rows and 3x3 square it belongs to. If the number can only fit in one cell, fill it in. c. Scanning 3x3 squares: For each missing number in a 3x3 square, check the rows and columns it belongs to. If the number can only fit in one cell, fill it in.
If no progress can be made with the above strategies, make an educated guess for a cell and continue solving. If a contradiction arises, backtrack and try a different number in the guessed cell.
The key is to systematically eliminate possibilities by applying the Sudoku rules and constraints until there is only one possible number for each cell. With practice, you can develop pattern recognition skills to solve Sudoku puzzles more efficiently.
