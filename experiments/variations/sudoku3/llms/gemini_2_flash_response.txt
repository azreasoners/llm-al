Explanation of how Sudoku is solved (General Case):

Sudoku puzzles are typically solved using a combination of logic and deduction. Here are the common strategies:

Scanning: Look for rows, columns, or 3x3 boxes that are nearly full. This helps identify the missing numbers.
Cross-hatching: If a number is present in a row and a column, it cannot appear in the intersection of that row and column in any of the 3x3 boxes. This helps narrow down possibilities.
Pencil Marking/Candidates: Write small "candidate" numbers in empty cells to indicate the possible values. As you deduce more information, you can eliminate candidates.
Hidden Singles: If a number can only appear in one cell within a row, column, or 3x3 box (even if there are other candidates in that cell), that number must be placed there.
Naked Pairs/Triples: If two or three cells in a row, column, or 3x3 box contain the same two or three candidates, those candidates can be eliminated from other cells in that row, column, or box.
