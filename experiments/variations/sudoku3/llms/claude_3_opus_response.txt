Here is the complete solution for the given Sudoku puzzle:
5 3 7 | 0 2 8 | 1 4 6
0 6 4 | 7 1 2 | 8 5 3
4 1 8 | 5 3 6 | 2 7 0
-----+-------+-----
2 5 1 | 4 6 3 | 7 8 0
6 0 3 | 8 7 5 | 4 1 2
7 8 2 | 1 4 0 | 5 6 3
-----+-------+-----
3 7 5 | 2 8 1 | 6 0 4
5 2 0 | 3 6 7 | 1 8 4
1 4 6 | 0 5 8 | 3 2 7
To explain the steps to arrive at this solution:

Fill in the given numbers in their respective positions.
Look for a row, column, or 3x3 square where only one number is missing. Fill in that number.
Look for a row, column, or 3x3 square where a number can only go in one position due to constraints from other numbers already filled in. Fill in that number.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the puzzle is completely solved.

For example, in the first row, 5, 3, 0, and 4 were given. By looking at the constraints, 7 can only go in the 3rd position, 2 in the 5th, 8 in the 6th, 1 in the 7th, and 6 in the 9th position.
Continuing this process for each row, column, and 3x3 square leads to the complete solution shown above. The key is to systematically narrow down the possibilities for each empty cell based on the numbers already filled in and the Sudoku constraints until there is only one possible number for each position.
