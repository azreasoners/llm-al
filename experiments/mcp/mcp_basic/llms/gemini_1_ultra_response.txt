Understanding the Problem

Types:

vessel: boat
location: bank1, bank2
group: missionaries, cannibals
integer: Numbers representing the quantity of missionaries or cannibals on each bank or in the boat
Rules:

The boat can carry a maximum of two people (or things).
Cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries on either bank, or they will eat them.
Cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries on the boat, or they will eat them.
The boat cannot move on its own; someone must be on board.
Solution

Here's a step-by-step solution to get everyone safely across:

Two cannibals (CC) cross to bank2.
bank1: 3M, 1C / boat: CC / bank2:
One cannibal (C) returns to bank1.
bank1: 3M, 2C / boat: C / bank2: C
Two missionaries (MM) cross to bank2.
bank1: 1M, 2C / boat: MM / bank2: 1C, 2M
One cannibal (C) returns to bank1.
bank1: 1M, 3C / boat: C / bank2: 2M, 1C
Two cannibals (CC) cross to bank2.
bank1: 1M / boat: CC / bank2: 2M, 3C
One cannibal (C) returns to bank1.
bank1: 1M, 1C / boat: C / bank2: 2M, 2C
Two missionaries (MM) cross to bank2.
bank1: / boat: MM / bank2: 3M, 3C
One missionary (M) and one cannibal (C) return to bank1.
bank1: 1M, 1C / boat: MC / bank2: 2M, 2C
Two cannibals (CC) cross to bank2.
bank1: 1M / boat: CC / bank2: 2M, 3C
One cannibal (C) returns to bank1.
bank1: 1M, 1C / boat: C / bank2: 2M, 2C
Two missionaries (MM) cross to bank2.
bank1: / boat: MM / bank2: 3M, 3C
Success! Everyone has crossed the river safely.
