Thought about missionaries and cannibals puzzle for 19 seconds
Evaluating constraints

OK, let me see: the boat carries up to 2 people, can't be empty, and cannibals mustn't outnumber missionaries on either side. I’m piecing together a plan.

Protecting missionaries

I’m focusing on ensuring cannibals never outnumber missionaries on the boat, even when no missionaries are on board. This safeguards all missionaries from harm.

Ensuring safety

OK, let me clarify: the rule prevents cannibals from outnumbering missionaries on the boat. Programs might involve sending two cannibals back and forth to keep things safe.

Charting the course

I’m outlining a strategy to safely ferry two cannibals and then two missionaries, cleverly ensuring they never outnumber the missionaries. Interestingly enough, this method keeps the dynamics balanced and safe.

Transferring safely

I’m thinking through strategies to ferry remaining missionaries and cannibals. Ensuring no missionaries are on the boat when two cannibals are transported keeps the process safe and balanced.

Ensuring the balance

I'm carefully monitoring the crossings, ensuring the boat's safety constraints are met. Each movement is checked, confirming safe progress.

Maintaining equilibrium

I’m mapping out the crossings, ensuring safe progress while keeping the cannibals and missionaries balanced. Each move is verified to meet safety constraints.

Finalizing safety checks

I’m piecing together the plan by confirming each boat scenario is secure. The boat can carry two passengers, ensuring all rules are consistently followed, leading to a successful solution.

Mapping the sequence

I’m laying out the move list in pairs, ensuring two passengers per trip, including cannibals. Each step is checked for safety and progression.

We can describe a valid solution as a sequence of “crossings” that move one or two people at a time without ever letting the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank or aboard the boat. (Remember: the boat may not cross empty and its capacity is 2.) One acceptable plan is as follows. In each move, we describe the numbers of missionaries and cannibals on board; for example, “(2M,0C)” means two missionaries and no cannibals are in the boat.

Let the two riverbanks be bank1 (the starting side) and bank2 (the destination). Initially:

bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
boat: at bank1
The plan below lists the moves (with the boat’s direction indicated):

Move 1 (bank1 → bank2):
Boat load: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Result:

bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal (3M,1C)
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals (0M,2C)
Move 2 (bank2 → bank1):
Boat load: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Result:

bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals (3M,2C)
bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal (0M,1C)
Move 3 (bank1 → bank2):
Boat load: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Result:

bank1: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals (3M,0C)
bank2: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals (0M,3C)
Move 4 (bank2 → bank1):
Boat load: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Result:

bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal (3M,1C)
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals (0M,2C)
Move 5 (bank1 → bank2):
Boat load: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals
(Note: With only missionaries on board, no risk arises on the boat.)
Result:

bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal (1M,1C)
bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals (2M,2C)
Move 6 (bank2 → bank1):
Boat load: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
(Equal numbers aboard are safe.)
Result:

bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals (2M,2C)
bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal (1M,1C)
Move 7 (bank1 → bank2):
Boat load: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Result:

bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals (0M,2C)
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal (3M,1C)
Move 8 (bank2 → bank1):
Boat load: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Result:

bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals (0M,3C)
bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals (3M,0C)
Move 9 (bank1 → bank2):
Boat load: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Result:

bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal (0M,1C)
bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals (3M,2C)
Move 10 (bank2 → bank1):
Boat load: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Result:

bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals (0M,2C)
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal (3M,1C)
Move 11 (bank1 → bank2):
Boat load: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Result:

bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals (0M,0C)
bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals (3M,3C)
At every step the conditions are met:

On each bank: Wherever there is at least one missionary, the number of cannibals does not exceed the number of missionaries.
On the boat: In any crossing that includes missionaries, the cannibals do not outnumber them.
Boat capacity: Never exceeded (always 1 or 2 people on board).
Boat is never empty when it crosses.
Thus, by the end of Move 11 all 3 missionaries and all 3 cannibals have safely reached bank2 with no danger of any missionary being eaten.

This plan satisfies the problem’s requirements.
