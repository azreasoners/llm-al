Okay, so I need to solve this classic missionaries and cannibals problem. Let me think through it step by step. The goal is to get all three missionaries and three cannibals from bank1 to bank2 using a boat that can carry at most two people. The main constraints are that on either bank, the cannibals can't outnumber the missionaries, and the same applies to the boat. Also, the boat can't cross empty.

First, let me outline the initial state. All three missionaries (M) and cannibals (C) are on bank1, and the boat is there too. The target is to get everyone to bank2.

I remember that in similar puzzles, you have to shuffle people back and forth, making sure that you never leave more cannibals than missionaries on any bank. The boat capacity here is two, so each trip can be 1 or 2 people, but not zero.

Let me start by considering possible moves. The first obvious move is to send two cannibals over. That would leave bank1 with 3M and 1C, which is safe because there are more missionaries. Bank2 would have 0M and 2C. Then, one cannibal has to come back. Wait, but if one comes back, then bank1 would have 3M and 2C, which is still safe. Then maybe send two cannibals again? But then bank2 would have 3C, and when the boat comes back, it's possible... Hmm, maybe that's not the right path because after a few trips, maybe the missionaries get outnumbered.

Alternatively, what if the first trip is one missionary and one cannibal? Then bank1 has 2M and 2C, which is okay, and bank2 has 1M and 1C. Then someone has to come back. If the missionary comes back, that's not helpful. If the cannibal comes back, then bank2 would have 1M and 0C, and bank1 would be back to 3M and 3C. That doesn't help. Maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe the first move should be two missionaries. Then bank1 has 1M and 3C. Oh, but that's a problem because the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on bank1. So that's invalid. So sending two missionaries first is bad. So that's not allowed.

So perhaps the first move has to be one missionary and one cannibal, but that might not be helpful. Or two cannibals. Let's try that.

First trip: 2C to bank2. Now, bank1 has 3M and 1C, bank2 has 0M and 2C. Then the boat is on bank2. Now someone needs to come back. If one C comes back, then bank1 has 3M and 2C, which is okay. Bank2 has 0M and 1C. Then, next trip: maybe send two Cs again. So boat takes 2C from bank1 (which now has 3M and 2C) to bank2. Wait, but after taking 2C, bank1 would have 3M and 0C, and bank2 would have 0M and 3C. Then the boat is at bank2. Now, someone has to go back. If one C comes back, bank2 has 0M and 2C, and bank1 has 3M and 1C. Then maybe take the last C over. But then bank1 would have 3M, and when the boat takes that last C, bank2 would have 0M and 3C, and then you still have the missionaries on bank1. But how do you get them across without issues?

Alternatively, maybe after the first trip of 2C, the boat returns with one C. Then, next trip: send two Cs again. So bank1 now has 3M and 2C -2C = 3M and 0C. Wait, no, if after the first trip, bank1 has 3M and 1C (after sending 2C, then one returns). Wait, let me retrace.

Initial state:

bank1: 3M, 3C, boat

bank2: 0M, 0C

Step 1: Send 2C to bank2. Now:

bank1: 3M, 1C

bank2: 0M, 2C, boat

Step 2: Send 1C back. Now:

bank1: 3M, 2C, boat

bank2: 0M, 1C

Step 3: Send 2C again to bank2. Now:

bank1: 3M, 0C

bank2: 0M, 3C, boat

Step 4: Send 1C back. Now:

bank1: 3M, 1C, boat

bank2: 0M, 2C

Now, we have to get the missionaries across. Let's try sending 2Ms. But bank1 has 3M, so sending 2M leaves 1M and 1C on bank1. Then bank2 would have 2M and 2C. Wait, but the boat is at bank2 now. Then someone needs to return. But if we send one M and one C back, that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe send one C back again? Hmm.

Wait, step 4: bank1 has 3M,1C and boat. Maybe instead of sending 2Ms, send 1M and 1C. Let's try that.

Step 4 alternative: Send 1M and 1C to bank2. Then bank1 has 2M, 0C; bank2 has 1M, 3C. But wait, on bank2, cannibals (3) outnumber missionaries (1). That's invalid. So that move is not allowed. So can't do that.

So maybe step 4: send 2Ms. Bank1 becomes 1M,1C. Bank2 has 2M,3C. Wait, but on bank2, cannibals (3) outnumber missionaries (2). So that's also invalid. So that's no good.

Hmm. So maybe this approach isn't working. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: Let's try to send one missionary and one cannibal first.

Step 1: Send 1M and 1C to bank2. Now:

bank1: 2M, 2C; bank2:1M,1C, boat.

Now, we need to return. If the missionary returns, then bank2 has 0M,1C; bank1 has 3M,2C. Then send two missionaries again. But then bank1 would have 1M,2C, which is unsafe. Alternatively, if the cannibal returns, then bank1 has 2M,3C, which is unsafe. So that's not possible. So the return trip has to be either one person (M or C) or two of the same. But if we send back the M and C, that's two people, but that's the same as the initial trip. So maybe after step 1, send back the missionary. So:

Step 2: 1M returns. Now bank1 has 3M,2C; bank2:0M,1C, boat.

But now bank1 has 3M and 2C, which is safe. Then step 3: send two Ms. Bank1 becomes 1M,2C; bank2 has 2M,1C. But bank1 now has 2C and 1M, which is unsafe (cannibals outnumber). So that's invalid.

Alternatively, step 3: send two Cs. From bank1 (3M,2C) send 2C to bank2. Now bank1 has 3M,0C; bank2 has 0M,3C. Then boat is at bank2. Then send one C back. Now bank1 has 3M,1C; bank2 has 0M,2C. Then send two Ms. But bank1 has 3M,1C. Sending two Ms leaves 1M,1C on bank1. Bank2 has 2M,2C. Then boat is at bank2. Then send one M and one C back. But this seems to get stuck.

Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let me recall that the classic solution involves multiple trips where sometimes cannibals and sometimes missionaries are moved. Let me try to outline the classic steps.

The standard solution for 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals:

1. Send 1M and 1C to the other side.

2. Bring back the M.

3. Send 2Cs to the other side.

4. Bring back 1C.

5. Send 2Ms to the other side.

6. Bring back 1M and 1C.

7. Send 2Ms to the other side.

8. Bring back 1C.

9. Send 2Cs to the other side.

10. Bring back 1C.

11. Send 2Cs to the other side.

Wait, but that might take more steps. Let me verify.

Alternatively, the standard solution is:

1. Two cannibals cross to bank2.

2. One cannibal returns.

3. Two cannibals cross again.

4. One cannibal returns.

5. Two missionaries cross.

6. One missionary and one cannibal return.

7. Two missionaries cross.

8. One cannibal returns.

9. Two cannibals cross.

10. One cannibal returns.

11. Two cannibals cross.

But this seems lengthy, and I might be mixing up steps. Let me try to work through it properly.

Alternatively, here's a possible valid sequence:

1. Send 1M and 1C to bank2. Now bank1 has 2M, 2C; bank2 has 1M,1C. Boat on bank2.

But then, we need to return. If the M returns, bank1 has 3M,2C; bank2 has 0M,1C. Then send two Ms. But when they arrive, bank2 has 2M,1C; bank1 has 1M,2C. But bank1 now has 2C vs 1M, which is unsafe. So that's bad.

Alternatively, after step 1, send the C back. So step 2: 1C returns. Now bank1 has 2M,3C; boat on bank1. But that's unsafe because 3C vs 2M on bank1. So that's invalid.

Hmm, so sending 1M and 1C first might not work. Let's try another approach.

Another classic approach is:

1. Send two cannibals to bank2. Bank1:3M,1C; bank2:0M,2C. Boat on bank2.

2. One cannibal returns. Bank1:3M,2C; bank2:0M,1C. Boat on bank1.

3. Send two cannibals again. Bank1:3M,0C; bank2:0M,3C. Boat on bank2.

4. One cannibal returns. Bank1:3M,1C; bank2:0M,2C. Boat on bank1.

Now, we need to get missionaries across. Let's try sending two missionaries.

5. Send two Ms. Bank1:1M,1C; bank2:2M,2C. Boat on bank2.

But on bank1, 1M and 1C is safe. On bank2, 2M and 2C is safe. Now, someone needs to return. If we send one M and one C back, that would be:

6. 1M and 1C return. Bank1:2M,2C; bank2:1M,1C. Boat on bank1.

Now, send two Ms again.

7. Send two Ms. Bank1:0M,2C; bank2:3M,1C. Boat on bank2.

But bank1 has 2C, which is okay because no missionaries there. Wait, but the problem states that cannibals may never outnumber missionaries on either side. If there are zero missionaries on bank1, then cannibals can't outnumber them. So that's allowed. So bank1 has 0M and 2C, which is okay. Then, send one cannibal back.

8. 1C returns. Bank1:0M,3C; bank2:3M,0C. Boat on bank1.

Wait, but bank1 now has 3C and boat. We need to get the boat back to bank2. But to do that, someone has to cross. The boat can't go empty. So we need to send two Cs from bank1 to bank2.

9. Send two Cs. Bank1:0M,1C; bank2:3M,2C. Boat on bank2.

Then send one C back.

10. 1C returns. Bank1:0M,2C; bank2:3M,1C. Boat on bank1.

Then send the last two Cs.

11. Send two Cs. Bank1:0M,0C; bank2:3M,3C. Done.

Wait, but step 7 leads to bank1 having 0M and 2C, which is allowed. Then step 8: send one C back, making bank1 have 3C, which is okay. Then step 9 sends two Cs over, leaving one C. Then step 10 brings one back, and step 11 sends the last two. But this seems to work. Let me check each step for validity.

Let me outline each step carefully:

1. Boat takes 2C from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 3M,1C; bank2:0M,2C. Valid (bank1 has 3M ≥1C; bank2 no M, so okay).

2. Boat returns with 1C.

- bank1:3M,2C; bank2:0M,1C. Valid (bank1: 3M ≥2C).

3. Boat takes 2C from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1:3M,0C; bank2:0M,3C. Valid (bank1: all M; bank2: no M, okay).

4. Boat returns with 1C.

- bank1:3M,1C; bank2:0M,2C. Valid.

5. Boat takes 2M from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1:1M,1C; bank2:2M,2C. Valid (both banks okay: 1M ≥1C on bank1; 2M ≥2C on bank2).

6. Boat returns with 1M and 1C.

- bank1:2M,2C; bank2:1M,1C. Valid (both banks: 2M ≥2C and 1M ≥1C).

7. Boat takes 2M from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1:0M,2C; bank2:3M,1C. Valid (bank1: no M, so okay; bank2:3M ≥1C).

8. Boat returns with 1C.

- bank1:0M,3C; bank2:3M,0C. Valid (bank1: no M; bank2: all M).

9. Boat takes 2C from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1:0M,1C; bank2:3M,2C. Valid.

10. Boat returns with 1C.

- bank1:0M,2C; bank2:3M,1C. Valid.

11. Boat takes 2C from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1:0M,0C; bank2:3M,3C. All done.

Yes, that seems to work. Each step maintains the constraints. Let me check step 6 again. After step 5, bank2 has 2M and 2C. Then the boat returns with 1M and 1C. So bank2 becomes 1M and 1C, which is okay (1M ≥1C). Bank1 becomes 1M+1M=2M and 1C+1C=2C. So 2M and 2C on bank1, which is okay. Then step 7 takes 2M from bank1 to bank2. Bank1 now 0M, 2C (okay), bank2 3M,1C (okay). Then step 8, boat returns with 1C. Bank1 has 0M,3C; bank2 has 3M,0C. Then step 9 takes 2C from bank1 (3C) to bank2, leaving 1C. Then step 10 returns 1C, and step 11 takes the last 2C.

Yes, this sequence works. So the steps are:

1. Two cannibals cross.

2. One returns.

3. Two cannibals cross again.

4. One returns.

5. Two missionaries cross.

6. One missionary and one cannibal return.

7. Two missionaries cross.

8. One cannibal returns.

9. Two cannibals cross.

10. One cannibal returns.

11. Two cannibals cross.

But wait, that's 11 steps. However, the problem says "Find a plan", so perhaps there's a shorter way. Let me check if I can condense some steps. Alternatively, maybe there's a different valid sequence with fewer steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 7, when bank1 has 0M,2C and bank2 has 3M,1C, instead of sending one C back, send two Cs over. Wait, but the boat is at bank2 after step7. So to get back to bank1, someone has to return. So step7 ends with boat at bank2. So step8 must be returning someone.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. Let me try another approach.

Alternative path:

1. Send 1M and 1C to bank2. (bank1:2M,2C; bank2:1M,1C)

2. Return with the M. (bank1:3M,2C; bank2:0M,1C)

3. Send 2Ms to bank2. (bank1:1M,2C; bank2:2M,1C)

4. Return with 1M and 1C. (bank1:2M,3C; bank2:1M,0C)

Wait, but bank1 now has 2M and 3C, which is invalid because 3C >2M. So this step is not allowed. So that's a problem.

Hmm, so that approach doesn't work. So maybe the earlier sequence is the correct one.

So the valid steps are as outlined before. Each step must ensure that on both banks, cannibals don't outnumber missionaries. Also, the boat must have at least one person and no more than two. And the boat's movements must alternate directions.

So translating this into the required format, which uses actions like sail, disembark, etc. But the problem statement doesn't specify the exact action names, but since it's about moving people, perhaps the steps involve moving the boat with certain people and disembarking them.

But the problem asks for a plan where each step is an action. The exact format may depend on how the answer is structured. Since the user mentions vessel, location, group, and integer types, but the actual actions are not specified. However, the standard way to present the solution is to list each crossing with who is in the boat and the direction.

So the answer would be a list of steps where the boat carries people from one bank to the other, then returns with some, etc. For example:

1. Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.

2. One cannibal returns to bank1.

3. Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.

4. One cannibal returns to bank1.

5. Two missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2.

6. One missionary and one cannibal return to bank1.

7. Two missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2.

8. One cannibal returns to bank1.

9. Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.

10. One cannibal returns to bank1.

11. Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.

But this seems lengthy. However, in reality, after step 7, there's a different approach. Let me recheck.

Wait, after step7: bank1 has 0M,2C; bank2 has 3M,1C. The boat is at bank2. So step8: send one cannibal back. Now bank1 has 0M,3C; boat at bank1. Then step9: send two cannibals to bank2. Now bank1 has 0M,1C; bank2 has 3M,3C. Wait, but step9 would be the 9th step. Then step10: send one cannibal back, but why? Because the boat is at bank2. Wait, after step9, the boat is at bank2 with 3M,3C. So we're done? No, because in step9, sending two cannibals from bank1 (which has 0M,3C after step8) to bank2 would require the boat to be at bank1. So step8: boat is at bank2, sends one cannibal back to bank1. Now bank1 has 0M,3C +1C (wait, no. After step7: bank1 has 0M,2C. Bank2 has 3M,1C. Then step8: send one C from bank2 to bank1. So bank1 becomes 0M,3C; bank2:3M,0C. Then step9: boat is at bank1. Now send two Cs to bank2: bank1 becomes 0M,1C; bank2:3M,2C. Boat at bank2. Then step10: send one C back. Bank1:0M,2C; bank2:3M,1C. Then step11: send two Cs to bank2. Done.

Yes, but that's 11 steps. So the answer should list each of these steps as actions where the boat sails with certain people and disembarks them.

In terms of the problem's terminology, the actions would involve moving the boat from one location to another, with the groups (missionaries and cannibals) being disembarked. So each step would be something like:

1. Sail the boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 cannibals.

2. Sail the boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 cannibal.

3. Sail the boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 cannibals.

4. Sail the boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 cannibal.

5. Sail the boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 missionaries.

6. Sail the boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 missionary and 1 cannibal.

7. Sail the boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 missionaries.

8. Sail the boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 cannibal.

9. Sail the boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 cannibals.

10. Sail the boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 cannibal.

11. Sail the boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 cannibals.

Each of these steps maintains the constraints. Now, converting this into the plan as per the problem's expected format. The problem likely expects each action to be a movement of the boat with a certain number of missionaries and cannibals, specifying the from and to locations, and the groups moved.

Therefore, the step-by-step plan would be:

1. Sail boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 cannibals.

2. Sail boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 cannibal.

3. Sail boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 cannibals.

4. Sail boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 cannibal.

5. Sail boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 missionaries.

6. Sail boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 missionary and 1 cannibal.

7. Sail boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 missionaries.

8. Sail boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 cannibal.

9. Sail boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 cannibals.

10. Sail boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 cannibal.

11. Sail boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 cannibals.

Each of these steps correctly moves the groups without violating the constraints. After the final step, all missionaries and cannibals are on bank2.

Here is the step-by-step plan to safely transport all missionaries and cannibals across the river:

Sail the boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 cannibals.

bank1: 3M, 1C | bank2: 0M, 2C

Sail the boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 cannibal.

bank1: 3M, 2C | bank2: 0M, 1C

Sail the boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 cannibals.

bank1: 3M, 0C | bank2: 0M, 3C

Sail the boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 cannibal.

bank1: 3M, 1C | bank2: 0M, 2C

Sail the boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 missionaries.

bank1: 1M, 1C | bank2: 2M, 2C

Sail the boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 missionary and 1 cannibal.

bank1: 2M, 2C | bank2: 1M, 1C

Sail the boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 missionaries.

bank1: 0M, 2C | bank2: 3M, 1C

Sail the boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 cannibal.

bank1: 0M, 3C | bank2: 3M, 0C

Sail the boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 cannibals.

bank1: 0M, 1C | bank2: 3M, 2C

Sail the boat from bank2 to bank1 with 1 cannibal.

bank1: 0M, 2C | bank2: 3M, 1C

Sail the boat from bank1 to bank2 with 2 cannibals.

bank1: 0M, 0C | bank2: 3M, 3C

Result: All missionaries and cannibals are safely at bank2.
