Here's a step-by-step solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, using the specified object types:

Initial State:

bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
boat: at bank1
Moves (M = Missionary, C = Cannibal):

Move: 1C, 1M from bank1 to bank2

bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
boat: at bank2
Move: 1M from bank2 to bank1

bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
boat: at bank1
Move: 2C from bank1 to bank2

bank1: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
boat: at bank2
Move: 1C from bank2 to bank1

bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
boat: at bank1
Move: 2M from bank1 to bank2

bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
boat: at bank2
Move: 1M, 1C from bank2 to bank1

bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
boat: at bank1
Move: 2M from bank1 to bank2

bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
boat: at bank2
Move: 1C from bank2 to bank1

bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
boat: at bank1
Move: 2C from bank1 to bank2

bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
boat: at bank2
Move: 1C from bank2 to bank1

bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
boat: at bank1
Move: 2C from bank1 to bank2

bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
boat: at bank2
Final State:

bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
boat: at bank2
All missionaries and cannibals have successfully crossed the river.
