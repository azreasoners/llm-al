Here's a plan to safely transport all missionaries and cannibals from bank1 to bank2:

1 missionary and 1 cannibal go from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
The 1 cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1 in the boat alone.
2 cannibals go from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
1 missionary and 1 cannibal return from bank2 to bank1 in the boat.
2 missionaries go from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
1 cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1 in the boat alone.
2 cannibals go from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
1 cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1 in the boat alone.
The remaining 2 missionaries go from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.

At the end, all 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals will be at bank2, with the boat also at bank2. At no point are the cannibals allowed to outnumber the missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
To summarize:

The boat makes 9 one-way trips total
Missionaries travel from bank1 to bank2 a total of 4 times (1 on trip 1, 1 on trip 5, 2 on trip 9)
Cannibals travel from bank1 to bank2 a total of 5 times (1 on trip 1, 2 on trip 3, 2 on trip 7)
The boat returns empty from bank2 to bank1 a total of 4 times (trips 2, 6, 8)
