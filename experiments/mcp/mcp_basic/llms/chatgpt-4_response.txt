To solve the problem of three missionaries and three cannibals crossing the river without any group outnumbering the other at any point, we can carefully plan the moves. The goal is to move all from one bank (bank1) to the other (bank2) while respecting the constraint that cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries at any location, including the boat.

Here's one possible plan to achieve the goal:

Move 1 cannibal and 1 missionary from bank1 to bank2.
State: Bank1 has 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals; Bank2 has 1 missionary, 1 cannibal; Boat is at bank2.
Return 1 cannibal to bank1.
State: Bank1 has 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals; Bank2 has 1 missionary, 0 cannibals; Boat is at bank1.
Move 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
State: Bank1 has 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal; Bank2 has 1 missionary, 2 cannibals; Boat is at bank2.
Return 1 cannibal to bank1.
State: Bank1 has 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals; Bank2 has 1 missionary, 1 cannibal; Boat is at bank1.
Move 2 missionaries from bank1 to bank2.
State: Bank1 has 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals; Bank2 has 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal; Boat is at bank2.
Return 1 missionary and 1 cannibal to bank1.
State: Bank1 has 1 missionary, 3 cannibals; Bank2 has 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals; Boat is at bank1.
Move 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
State: Bank1 has 1 missionary, 1 cannibal; Bank2 has 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals; Boat is at bank2.
Return 1 cannibal to bank1.
State: Bank1 has 1 missionary, 2 cannibals; Bank2 has 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal; Boat is at bank1.
Move 1 missionary and 1 cannibal from bank1 to bank2.
State: Bank1 has 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal; Bank2 has 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals; Boat is at bank2.
Return 1 cannibal to bank1.
State: Bank1 has 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals; Bank2 has 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal; Boat is at bank1.
Move 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
State: Bank1 has 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals; Bank2 has 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals; Boat is at bank2.
This sequence ensures that at no point do cannibals outnumber missionaries at any location or on the boat, meeting all the given constraints.
