Alright, so I've got this problem here about missionaries and cannibals crossing a river. There are three missionaries and three cannibals on one side of the river, and they need to get to the other side using a boat that can carry at most two people at a time. The boat can't cross the river with nothing on it, and there are some rules about how many missionaries and cannibals can be on either side of the river at any given time.

Okay, let's see. The main thing is that cannibals can't outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat, otherwise, the missionaries get eaten. So, I need to make sure that on both sides of the river and in the boat, the number of missionaries is greater than or equal to the number of cannibals, or there are no missionaries present.

First, I need to figure out how to get everyone across without breaking these rules. Let's start by thinking about the boat. It can carry up to two people, and it can't go empty. So, every trip must have at least one person in it.

I think I should keep track of how many missionaries and cannibals are on each bank and in the boat at each step. Maybe I can represent the state as something like (M, C, B), where M is the number of missionaries on the starting bank, C is the number of cannibals on the starting bank, and B is the position of the boat (on which bank it is).

Initially, we have (3, 3, 1), meaning three missionaries and three cannibals on bank1, and the boat is also on bank1.

The goal is to reach (0, 0, 2), meaning no missionaries and no cannibals on bank1, and the boat is on bank2.

Now, I need to think about possible moves. Each move involves moving one or two people from one bank to the other, but I have to make sure that after each move, the number of missionaries is not less than the number of cannibals on either bank.

Let me try to list out possible moves:

1. Move two missionaries from bank1 to bank2.

- New state: (1, 3, 2)

- Check bank1: 1 missionary and 3 cannibals. Oops, cannibals outnumber missionaries. Not allowed.

2. Move one missionary and one cannibal from bank1 to bank2.

- New state: (2, 2, 2)

- Check bank1: 2 missionaries and 2 cannibals. That's equal, which is okay.

- Check bank2: 1 missionary and 1 cannibal. Also equal. Looks good.

Okay, that seems like a valid move. So now we're at (2, 2, 2).

Now, the boat is on bank2. Next move should be to bring someone back to bank1. Because the boat can't stay on bank2 with no one there.

Let's consider moving one person back to bank1.

Option 1: Move one missionary back.

- New state: (3, 2, 1)

- Check bank1: 3 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Good.

- Check bank2: 1 missionary and 2 cannibals. Cannibals outnumber missionaries. Not allowed.

Option 2: Move one cannibal back.

- New state: (2, 3, 1)

- Check bank1: 2 missionaries and 3 cannibals. Cannibals outnumber missionaries. Not allowed.

Option 3: Move one missionary and one cannibal back.

- New state: (3, 3, 1)

- That's where we started. Not helpful.

Hmm, seems like moving one person back doesn't work. Maybe I need to move two people back.

Option: Move two cannibals back.

- New state: (2, 5, 1)

- Wait, that doesn't make sense. There were only three cannibals initially.

Wait, no. If we're moving two cannibals back from bank2 to bank1, but bank2 only has one cannibal at this point. So that's not possible.

Wait, let's double-check. From the state (2, 2, 2), bank2 has one missionary and one cannibal. So moving two cannibals back isn't possible because there's only one cannibal on bank2.

Maybe moving one cannibal back isn't allowed because it leads to an imbalance on bank2.

This seems tricky. Maybe moving one cannibal back is the only option, but it causes a problem on bank2.

Let me think differently. Maybe I should try a different initial move.

Alternative initial move: Move two cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

- New state: (3, 1, 2)

- Check bank1: 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal. Good.

- Check bank2: 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Since there are no missionaries, it's okay.

Okay, that works. Now we're at (3, 1, 2).

Now, boat is on bank2. Need to bring someone back to bank1.

Option 1: Move one cannibal back.

- New state: (3, 2, 1)

- Check bank1: 3 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Good.

- Check bank2: 0 missionaries and 1 cannibal. Okay.

Option 2: Move one missionary back.

- New state: (4, 1, 1)

- Wait, we only have three missionaries total. Can't have 4. Invalid.

Option 3: Move one missionary and one cannibal back.

- New state: (4, 2, 1)

- Again, invalid for the same reason.

So, only option is to move one cannibal back to bank1, resulting in (3, 2, 1).

Now, from (3, 2, 1), boat is on bank1.

Next move: Move two cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

- New state: (3, 0, 2)

- Check bank1: 3 missionaries and 0 cannibals. Good.

- Check bank2: 0 missionaries and 3 cannibals. Since no missionaries are present, it's okay.

Now, boat is on bank2.

Need to bring someone back to bank1.

Option 1: Move one cannibal back.

- New state: (3, 1, 1)

- Check bank1: 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal. Good.

- Check bank2: 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Okay.

Option 2: Move one missionary back.

- New state: (4, 0, 1)

- Invalid, as we only have three missionaries.

Option 3: Move one missionary and one cannibal back.

- New state: (4, 1, 1)

- Invalid again.

So, move one cannibal back to bank1, resulting in (3, 1, 1).

From here, boat is on bank1.

Next move: Move two cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

- New state: (3, -1, 2)

- Wait, can't have negative cannibals. That doesn't make sense.

Oops, I must have messed up the counts.

Wait, from (3, 1, 1), moving two cannibals from bank1 to bank2 would require bank1 to have 1 cannibal, and moving two would mean negative, which is impossible.

So, can't do that.

Alternative move: Move one cannibal from bank1 to bank2.

- New state: (3, 0, 2)

- But we already were at (3, 0, 2) earlier.

This seems like a loop.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let's try another initial move.

Alternative initial move: Move one missionary and one cannibal from bank1 to bank2.

- New state: (2, 2, 2)

- As before.

Then, moving one cannibal back to bank1 results in (2, 3, 1).

Wait, earlier I thought that was not allowed, but let's check again.

From (2, 2, 2), move one cannibal back to bank1:

- Bank1: 2 missionaries and 3 cannibals. Cannibals outnumber missionaries. Not allowed.

So, that doesn't work.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to try moving two missionaries first, even though it led to a problem.

From (3, 3, 1), move two missionaries to bank2:

- New state: (1, 3, 2)

- Bank1: 1 missionary and 3 cannibals. Cannibals outnumber missionaries. Not allowed.

Okay, bad move.

Alternative idea: Maybe move two cannibals first, as I did earlier, and then see.

From (3, 3, 1), move two cannibals to bank2:

- New state: (3, 1, 2)

- Bank1: 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Good.

Then, move one cannibal back to bank1:

- New state: (3, 2, 1)

- Bank1: 3 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries and 1 cannibal. Good.

Now, from (3, 2, 1), move two cannibals to bank2:

- New state: (3, 0, 2)

- Bank1: 3 missionaries and 0 cannibals. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries and 3 cannibals. Good.

Then, move one cannibal back to bank1:

- New state: (3, 1, 1)

- Bank1: 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Good.

From here, it seems stuck.

Wait, maybe I need to move a different combination.

From (3, 1, 1), move one missionary and one cannibal to bank2:

- New state: (2, 0, 2)

- Bank1: 2 missionaries and 1 cannibal. Good.

- Bank2: 1 missionary and 2 cannibals. Cannibals outnumber missionaries. Not allowed.

No good.

Alternative move: Move two missionaries to bank2.

- New state: (1, 1, 2)

- Bank1: 1 missionary and 1 cannibal. Equal, which is okay.

- Bank2: 2 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Equal, which is okay.

Then, move one missionary back to bank1:

- New state: (2, 1, 1)

- Bank1: 2 missionaries and 1 cannibal. Good.

- Bank2: 1 missionary and 2 cannibals. Cannibals outnumber missionaries. Not allowed.

No good.

Alternative: From (1, 1, 2), move one cannibal back to bank1.

- New state: (1, 2, 1)

- Bank1: 1 missionary and 2 cannibals. Cannibals outnumber missionaries. Not allowed.

No good.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to try a different sequence altogether.

Let's consider another approach.

From (3, 3, 1), move one missionary and one cannibal to bank2:

- New state: (2, 2, 2)

- Bank1: 2 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Equal, okay.

- Bank2: 1 missionary and 1 cannibal. Equal, okay.

Then, move one cannibal back to bank1:

- New state: (2, 3, 1)

- Bank1: 2 missionaries and 3 cannibals. Cannibals outnumber missionaries. Not allowed.

Same problem as before.

Alternative: From (2, 2, 2), move one missionary back to bank1.

- New state: (3, 2, 1)

- Bank1: 3 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Good.

Then, from (3, 2, 1), move two cannibals to bank2:

- New state: (3, 0, 2)

- Bank1: 3 missionaries and 0 cannibals. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries and 3 cannibals. Good.

Then, move one cannibal back to bank1:

- New state: (3, 1, 1)

- Bank1: 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Good.

From here, move one missionary and one cannibal to bank2:

- New state: (2, 0, 2)

- Bank1: 2 missionaries and 1 cannibal. Good.

- Bank2: 1 missionary and 3 cannibals. Cannibals outnumber missionaries. Not allowed.

No good.

This is frustrating. Maybe I need to try moving different combinations.

Let's try starting by moving two cannibals first, as I did earlier.

From (3, 3, 1), move two cannibals to bank2:

- New state: (3, 1, 2)

- Bank1: 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Good.

Then, move one cannibal back to bank1:

- New state: (3, 2, 1)

- Bank1: 3 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries and 1 cannibal. Good.

Now, from (3, 2, 1), move two cannibals to bank2:

- New state: (3, 0, 2)

- Bank1: 3 missionaries and 0 cannibals. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries and 3 cannibals. Good.

Then, move one cannibal back to bank1:

- New state: (3, 1, 1)

- Bank1: 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Good.

From here, move one missionary and one cannibal to bank2:

- New state: (2, 0, 2)

- Bank1: 2 missionaries and 1 cannibal. Good.

- Bank2: 1 missionary and 2 cannibals. Cannibals outnumber missionaries. Not allowed.

Same problem again.

Maybe I need to try a different sequence.

From (3, 1, 2), after moving two cannibals to bank2, instead of moving one cannibal back, maybe move something else.

Wait, no. The boat is on bank2, and I have to bring someone back.

Only option is to move one cannibal back to bank1, as moving a missionary isn't possible because there are no missionaries on bank2.

So, stuck again.

Perhaps I need to try moving one missionary and one cannibal first.

From (3, 3, 1), move one missionary and one cannibal to bank2:

- New state: (2, 2, 2)

- Bank1: 2 missionaries and 2 cannibals. Good.

- Bank2: 1 missionary and 1 cannibal. Good.

Then, move one cannibal back to bank1:

- New state: (2, 3, 1)

- Bank1: 2 missionaries and 3 cannibals. Cannibals outnumber missionaries. Not allowed.

Same issue.

This is really tricky. Maybe there's a different way to approach this.

Wait a minute, I recall there's a standard solution to this puzzle. Let me try to recall it.

First, move two cannibals to bank2.

Then, move one cannibal back to bank1.

Then, move two cannibals to bank2 again.

Then, move one cannibal back to bank1.

Then, move two cannibals to bank2.

Now, all cannibals are on bank2, and the boat is on bank2.

Then, move two missionaries to bank2.

Now, move one missionary and one cannibal back to bank1.

Then, move two missionaries to bank2.

Then, move one cannibal back to bank1.

Finally, move two cannibals to bank2.

Wait, that seems complicated, and I might be mixing up the steps.

Let me try to write it down step by step.

Step 1: Move two cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

- State: (3, 1, 2)

Step 2: Move one cannibal back from bank2 to bank1.

- State: (3, 2, 1)

Step 3: Move two cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

- State: (3, 0, 2)

Step 4: Move one cannibal back from bank2 to bank1.

- State: (3, 1, 1)

Step 5: Move two missionaries from bank1 to bank2.

- State: (1, 1, 2)

Step 6: Move one missionary and one cannibal back to bank1.

- State: (2, 2, 1)

Step 7: Move two missionaries from bank1 to bank2.

- State: (0, 2, 2)

Step 8: Move one cannibal back from bank2 to bank1.

- State: (0, 3, 1)

Step 9: Move two cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

- State: (0, 1, 2)

Step 10: Move one cannibal back from bank2 to bank1.

- State: (0, 2, 1)

Step 11: Move two cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

- State: (0, 0, 2)

Okay, that seems to work. Let me check each step to ensure that the constraints are satisfied.

Step 1: Move two cannibals to bank2.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals. Good.

Step 2: Move one cannibal back to bank1.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal. Good.

Step 3: Move two cannibals to bank2.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals. Good.

Step 4: Move one cannibal back to bank1.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal. Good.

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals. Good.

Step 5: Move two missionaries to bank2.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal. Good.

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals. Good.

Step 6: Move one missionary and one cannibal back to bank1.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals. Good.

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal. Good.

Step 7: Move two missionaries to bank2.

- Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals. Good.

- Bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal. Good.

Step 8: Move one cannibal back to bank1.

- Bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals. Good.

- Bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals. Good.

Step 9: Move two cannibals to bank2.

- Bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal. Good.

- Bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals. Good.

Step 10: Move one cannibal back to bank1.

- Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals. Good.

- Bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal. Good.

Step 11: Move two cannibals to bank2.

- Bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals. Good.

- Bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals. Good.

Yes, that works! So, the sequence of moves is:

1. Move two cannibals to bank2.

2. Move one cannibal back to bank1.

3. Move two cannibals to bank2.

4. Move one cannibal back to bank1.

5. Move two missionaries to bank2.

6. Move one missionary and one cannibal back to bank1.

7. Move two missionaries to bank2.

8. Move one cannibal back to bank1.

9. Move two cannibals to bank2.

10. Move one cannibal back to bank1.

11. Move two cannibals to bank2.

This successfully gets all missionaries and cannibals to bank2 without breaking any of the rules.

To solve the problem of getting three missionaries and three cannibals across the river, while ensuring that cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat, follow these steps:

Initial State:

Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

Boat: At Bank1

Step 1: Move two cannibals from Bank1 to Bank2.

Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

Step 2: Move one cannibal back from Bank2 to Bank1.

Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

Step 3: Move two cannibals from Bank1 to Bank2.

Bank1: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals

Bank2: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals

Step 4: Move one cannibal back from Bank2 to Bank1.

Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

Step 5: Move two missionaries from Bank1 to Bank2.

Bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

Bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

Step 6: Move one missionary and one cannibal back to Bank1.

Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

Step 7: Move two missionaries from Bank1 to Bank2.

Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

Bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

Step 8: Move one cannibal back from Bank2 to Bank1.

Bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals

Bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals

Step 9: Move two cannibals from Bank1 to Bank2.

Bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

Bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

Step 10: Move one cannibal back from Bank2 to Bank1.

Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

Bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

Step 11: Move two cannibals from Bank1 to Bank2.

Bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

Bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

All missionaries and cannibals are now safely at Bank2, and no rules were violated during the process.
