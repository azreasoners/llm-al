% constraints/rules

% 1. Crossing a vessel causes its loc(vessel) to change to the other bank.
cross(V) causes loc(V) = bank2 if loc(V) = bank1.
cross(V) causes loc(V) = bank1 if loc(V) = bank2.

% 2. Crossing a vessel causes numAt(group, loc(vessel)) to decrease by transporting(vessel, group) for each group.
cross(V) decrements numAt(G, loc(V)) by N if transporting(V, G) = N.

% 3. Crossing a vessel causes numAt(group, the other bank) to increase by transporting(vessel, group) for each group.
cross(V) increments numAt(G, bank2) by N if transporting(V, G) = N & loc(V) = bank1.
cross(V) increments numAt(G, bank1) by N if transporting(V, G) = N & loc(V) = bank2.

% 4. The action cross(vessel) is not executable if the sum of transporting(vessel, missionaries) and transporting(vessel, cannibals) is zero.
nonexecutable cross(V) if N1 + N2 = 0 & N1 = transporting(V, missionaries) & N2 = transporting(V, cannibals).

% 5. The action cross(vessel) is not executable if the sum of transporting(vessel, group) exceeds capacity(vessel).
nonexecutable cross(V) if N1 + N2 > N3 & N1 = transporting(V, missionaries) & N2 = transporting(V, cannibals) & N3 = capacity(V).

% 6. The action cross(vessel) is not executable if transporting(vessel, group) exceeds numAt(group, loc(vessel)) for any group.
nonexecutable cross(V) if N1 > N2 & N1 = transporting(V, G) & N2 = numAt(G, loc(V)).

% 7. The action cross(vessel) is not executable if transporting(vessel, group) is negative for any group.
nonexecutable cross(V) if N1 < 0 & N1 = transporting(V, G).

% 8. It is not allowed for numAt(cannibals, location) to exceed numAt(missionaries, location) at any location where numAt(missionaries, location) is greater than zero.
always numAt(cannibals, Loc) <= numAt(missionaries, Loc) | numAt(missionaries, Loc) = 0.

% 9. The action cross(vessel) is not executable if transporting(vessel, cannibals) exceeds transporting(vessel, missionaries) during the crossing when transporting(vessel, missionaries) is greater than zero.
nonexecutable cross(V) if N_c > N_m & N_m > 0 & N_c = transporting(V, cannibals) & N_m = transporting(V, missionaries).

% 13. The capacity of the vessel is 3.
capacity(boat1) = 3.

% 16. The numAt(group, location) is always between 0 and 6 inclusive for each group.
always numAt(G, Loc) >= 0 & numAt(G, Loc) <= 6.

% 17. The total number of missionaries remains constant across both banks.
always N_m1 + N_m2 = 6 & N_m1 = numAt(missionaries, bank1) & N_m2 = numAt(missionaries, bank2).
% The total number of cannibals remains constant across both banks.
always N_c1 + N_c2 = 6 & N_c1 = numAt(cannibals, bank1) & N_c2 = numAt(cannibals, bank2).
