The Missionaries and Cannibals problem is a classic example of a constraint satisfaction problem. To solve it, we need to define a sequence of valid moves that transfers all missionaries and cannibals from bank1 to bank2 without violating the constraints:

Constraints:

The boat can carry at most two people.
Cannibals can never outnumber missionaries on either bank or on the boat.
The boat cannot cross the river empty.
Initial State:

bank1: 6 missionaries, 6 cannibals.
bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals.
boat: At bank1.
Goal State:

bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals.
bank2: 6 missionaries, 6 cannibals.
boat: At bank2.
Representation: A state can be represented as a tuple 
(
𝑀
1
,
𝐶
1
,
𝐵
)
(M 
1
​
 ,C 
1
​
 ,B), where:

𝑀
1
M 
1
​
  is the number of missionaries on bank1.
𝐶
1
C 
1
​
  is the number of cannibals on bank1.
𝐵
B indicates the boat's location (bank1 or bank2).
Transitions: Valid moves involve transferring 
𝑥
x missionaries and 
𝑦
y cannibals (

≤
𝑥
+
𝑦
≤
2
,
𝑥
,
𝑦
≥

0≤x+y≤2,x,y≥0) across the river, subject to constraints.

Solution: A solution involves generating a valid sequence of states that transition from the initial state to the goal state. Here's one possible sequence:

At each step, validate the state to ensure no constraints are violated. This plan guarantees all 6 missionaries and 6 cannibals safely cross the river.
