To solve this classic problem of missionaries and cannibals crossing a river, we need to develop a strategy that ensures all individuals safely reach the other bank without violating the constraints. Let's define some key points and then proceed with a strategy:

State Representation: A state can be represented as (M, C, B), where:
M = Number of missionaries on the starting bank.
C = Number of cannibals on the starting bank.
B = Location of the boat (0 for starting bank, 1 for opposite bank).
Initial State: The initial state is (6, 6, 0) - six missionaries and six cannibals are on bank1 (starting bank), and the boat is also on bank1.
Goal State: The goal state is (0, 0, 1) - no missionaries or cannibals on the starting bank, and the boat is on the opposite bank (bank2).
Transitions: You can move between states by transferring 1 or 2 individuals (either missionaries or cannibals or both) across the river, ensuring that at no point do cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank or on the boat itself.
Validity Check for States:
On either bank, missionaries (if present) should not be outnumbered by cannibals.
The same applies to the boat during the crossing.
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step strategy to solve the problem:

(6, 6, 0) to (6, 5, 1): Send 1 cannibal to the other bank.
(6, 5, 1) to (6, 6, 0): Return 1 cannibal.
(6, 6, 0) to (5, 6, 1): Send 1 missionary and 1 cannibal.
(5, 6, 1) to (6, 6, 0): Return 1 missionary.
(6, 6, 0) to (4, 6, 1): Send 2 missionaries.
(4, 6, 1) to (5, 6, 0): Return 1 missionary.
(5, 6, 0) to (3, 6, 1): Send 2 missionaries.
(3, 6, 1) to (4, 6, 0): Return 1 missionary.
(4, 6, 0) to (4, 4, 1): Send 2 cannibals.
(4, 4, 1) to (5, 4, 0): Return 1 missionary.
(5, 4, 0) to (5, 2, 1): Send 2 cannibals.
(5, 2, 1) to (6, 2, 0): Return 1 missionary.
(6, 2, 0) to (6, 0, 1): Send 2 cannibals.
(6, 0, 1) to (6, 1, 0): Return 1 cannibal.
(6, 1, 0) to (6, 0, 1): Send 1 cannibal.
Finally, all individuals have successfully crossed to the other bank, adhering to all rules, and the goal state (0, 0, 1) is achieved. This series of transitions avoids any situation where cannibals outnumber missionaries.
