To solve the problem where three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river using a boat that carries at most two people, while ensuring that the cannibals never outnumber the missionaries on either bank or in the boat, you can use a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step solution:

Initial State:
Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, 1 boat
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Crossings:
Crossing 1: Two cannibals cross from Bank1 to Bank2.
New State:
Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Crossing 2: One cannibal returns to Bank1.
New State:
Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Crossing 3: Two missionaries cross from Bank1 to Bank2.
New State:
Bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Crossing 4: One missionary and one cannibal return to Bank1.
New State:
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals
Crossing 5: Two missionaries cross from Bank1 to Bank2.
New State:
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Crossing 6: One cannibal returns to Bank1.
New State:
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 4 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals (impossible state, as cannibals outnumber missionaries)
Corrected Crossing 6: Two cannibals cross from Bank1 to Bank2.
New State:
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Crossing 7: One cannibal returns to Bank1.
New State:
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Crossing 8: Two cannibals cross from Bank1 to Bank2.
Final State:
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
This plan ensures that at no point do cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat, and it achieves the goal of getting all three missionaries and three cannibals safely to the other side of the river. Each crossing either includes at least one rower capable of managing the boat (either a missionary or a cannibal as specified).
