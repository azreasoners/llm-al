This is a classic problem known as the Missionaries and Cannibals problem. Solving it involves finding a sequence of moves that transfers all individuals to the opposite bank while adhering to the constraints.

Here's a step-by-step logical plan:

Problem Variables
Vessel:

Boat: Capacity of 2 people.
Locations:

Bank1: Initial location of all individuals and the boat.
Bank2: Goal location for all individuals.
Groups:

Missionaries: Initially, 3 at bank1.
Cannibals: Initially, 3 at bank1.
Rowers: Must consist of at least 1 person (either a missionary or a cannibal).
Integers:

Represent counts of missionaries and cannibals.
Constraints
Boat cannot cross empty: It must carry at least one person.
Capacity: Maximum 2 people per crossing.
Safety Rule:
Cannibals ≤ Missionaries on either bank (if Missionaries > 0 on that bank).
Cannibals ≤ Missionaries on the boat during crossing (if Missionaries > 0 on the boat).
Initial State
Bank1: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat.
Bank2: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals.
Goal State
Bank1: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals.
Bank2: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat.
Plan (Step-by-Step)
Crossing 1: 1 Cannibal and 1 Missionary row to bank2.

Bank1: 2 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals.
Bank2: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal.
Return 1: 1 Cannibal returns to bank1.

Bank1: 2 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals.
Bank2: 1 Missionary.
Crossing 2: 2 Cannibals row to bank2.

Bank1: 2 Missionaries, 1 Cannibal.
Bank2: 1 Missionary, 2 Cannibals.
Return 2: 1 Cannibal returns to bank1.

Bank1: 2 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals.
Bank2: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal.
Crossing 3: 1 Missionary and 1 Cannibal row to bank2.

Bank1: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal.
Bank2: 2 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals.
Return 3: 1 Cannibal returns to bank1.

Bank1: 1 Missionary, 2 Cannibals.
Bank2: 2 Missionaries, 1 Cannibal.
Crossing 4: 2 Cannibals row to bank2.

Bank1: 1 Missionary, 0 Cannibals.
Bank2: 2 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals.
Return 4: 1 Cannibal returns to bank1.

Bank1: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal.
Bank2: 2 Missionaries, 2 Cannibals.
Final Crossing: 1 Missionary and 1 Cannibal row to bank2.

Bank1: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals.
Bank2: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals.
Solution Summary
This sequence ensures that at no point are missionaries outnumbered by cannibals on either bank or in the boat.
