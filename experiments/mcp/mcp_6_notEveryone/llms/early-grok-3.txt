This is a classic river crossing puzzle, and we'll solve it step by step while adhering to the constraints and using the specified types (vessel, location, group, basicGroup, integer). Let's break it down:

---

### Problem Setup:
- **Vessel**: `boat` (capacity = 2, must have at least 1 person to row, and cannot cross empty).
- **Locations**: `bank1` (starting side), `bank2` (destination side).
- **BasicGroups**:
  - `missionaries` (3 missionaries initially at `bank1`).
  - `cannibals` (3 cannibals initially at `bank1`).
  - `rowers` (a subset of missionaries and cannibals who can row; only 1 missionary and 1 cannibal can row).
- **Integers**: 0 to 10 (used for counting missionaries, cannibals, and boat capacity).

### Constraints:
1. The boat can carry at most 2 people at a time.
2. The boat cannot cross the river empty (must have at least 1 person to row).
3. On either bank, cannibals must not outnumber missionaries (or missionaries will be eaten).
   - Example: If there are 2 cannibals and 1 missionary on a bank, the missionary is eaten (invalid state).
4. In the boat, cannibals must not outnumber missionaries (or missionaries will be eaten).
   - Example: If the boat has 2 cannibals and 1 missionary, the missionary is eaten (invalid state).
5. Only 1 missionary and 1 cannibal can row. At least one rower must be in the boat for it to cross.

### Goal:
- Move all 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals from `bank1` to `bank2` without violating any constraints.

---

### State Representation:
We represent the state as:
- `(M1, C1, B, M2, C2)`
  - `M1`: Number of missionaries on `bank1`.
  - `C1`: Number of cannibals on `bank1`.
  - `B`: Location of the boat (`bank1` or `bank2`).
  - `M2`: Number of missionaries on `bank2`.
  - `C2`: Number of cannibals on `bank2`.

Initial state: `(3, 3, bank1, 0, 0)`  
Goal state: `(0, 0, bank2, 3, 3)`

---

### Validity Check:
A state is valid if:
1. On `bank1`: If `M1 > 0`, then `C1 ≤ M1` (cannibals do not outnumber missionaries).
2. On `bank2`: If `M2 > 0`, then `C2 ≤ M2`.
3. In the boat: If there are missionaries in the boat, cannibals must not outnumber them.

---

### Rowing Constraint:
- Only 1 missionary (`M`) and 1 cannibal (`C`) can row.
- For the boat to move, at least one rower must be on board.
- Possible boat configurations (considering capacity = 2 and rowing constraint):
  - 1 rower (M or C).
  - 2 rowers (M and C).
  - 1 rower (M or C) + 1 non-rower (M or C, but cannibals must not outnumber missionaries in the boat).

---

### Solution:
We will list the steps to move from the initial state to the goal state. Each step specifies:
- The state before the move.
- The boat's passengers (and who rows).
- The state after the move.

#### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Initial State**: `(3, 3, bank1, 0, 0)`
   - Move: 1 missionary (M, rower) and 1 cannibal (C, non-rower) cross to `bank2`.
   - New State: `(2, 2, bank2, 1, 1)`  
     (Valid: `bank1` has 2M, 2C; `bank2` has 1M, 1C.)

2. **State**: `(2, 2, bank2, 1, 1)`
   - Move: 1 missionary (M, rower) returns to `bank1`.
   - New State: `(3, 2, bank1, 0, 1)`  
     (Valid: `bank1` has 3M, 2C; `bank2` has 0M, 1C.)

3. **State**: `(3, 2, bank1, 0, 1)`
   - Move: 1 missionary (M, rower) and 1 cannibal (C, non-rower) cross to `bank2`.
   - New State: `(2, 1, bank2, 1, 2)`  
     (Valid: `bank1` has 2M, 1C; `bank2` has 1M, 2C.)

4. **State**: `(2, 1, bank2, 1, 2)`
   - Move: 1 missionary (M, rower) returns to `bank1`.
   - New State: `(3, 1, bank1, 0, 2)`  
     (Valid: `bank1` has 3M, 1C; `bank2` has 0M, 2C.)

5. **State**: `(3, 1, bank1, 0, 2)`
   - Move: 1 missionary (M, rower) and 1 cannibal (C, non-rower) cross to `bank2`.
   - New State: `(2, 0, bank2, 1, 3)`  
     (Valid: `bank1` has 2M, 0C; `bank2` has 1M, 3C.)

6. **State**: `(2, 0, bank2, 1, 3)`
   - Move: 1 missionary (M, rower) returns to `bank1`.
   - New State: `(3, 0, bank1, 0, 3)`  
     (Valid: `bank1` has 3M, 0C; `bank2` has 0M, 3C.)

7. **State**: `(3, 0, bank1, 0, 3)`
   - Move: 1 missionary (M, rower) and 1 missionary (M, non-rower) cross to `bank2`.
   - New State: `(1, 0, bank2, 2, 3)`  
     (Valid: `bank1` has 1M, 0C; `bank2` has 2M, 3C.)

8. **State**: `(1, 0, bank2, 2, 3)`
   - Move: 1 missionary (M, rower) returns to `bank1`.
   - New State: `(2, 0, bank1, 1, 3)`  
     (Valid: `bank1` has 2M, 0C; `bank2` has 1M, 3C.)

9. **State**: `(2, 0, bank1, 1, 3)`
   - Move: 1 missionary (M, rower) and 1 missionary (M, non-rower) cross to `bank2`.
   - New State: `(0, 0, bank2, 3, 3)`  
     (Valid: `bank1` has 0M, 0C; `bank2` has 3M, 3C.)

#### Final State:
- `(0, 0, bank2, 3, 3)`  
  All missionaries and cannibals are on `bank2`. Goal achieved!

### Summary:
- The plan involves 9 boat trips.
- Each trip adheres to the constraints:
  - Boat capacity ≤ 2.
  - At least 1 rower (M or C) is on board.
  - Cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
- The solution uses the specified types (vessel, location, basicGroup, integer) and ensures all conditions are met.
