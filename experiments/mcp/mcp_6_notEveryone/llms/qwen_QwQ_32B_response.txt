Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have three missionaries and three cannibals who need to cross a river using a boat that can carry at most two people at a time. The boat can't cross the river with nothing on it, and there are some restrictions to make sure that missionaries aren't eaten by cannibals.

First, I need to understand the constraints:

1. The boat can carry at most two people.

2. The boat can't cross the river empty.

3. On either bank (bank1 or bank2), cannibals must not outnumber missionaries; otherwise, the missionaries will be eaten.

4. On the boat, cannibals must not outnumber missionaries; otherwise, the missionaries will be eaten.

5. Only one missionary and one cannibal can row the boat.

Wait, point 5 says that only one missionary and one cannibal can row the boat. Does that mean that for the boat to move, there must be at least one missionary and one cannibal rowing it? Or does it mean that only one missionary and one cannibal are capable of rowing, but they don't have to be on the boat every time it crosses?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

"only one missionary and one cannibal can row."

I think it means that only one missionary and one cannibal are capable of rowing the boat. So, for the boat to move, there must be at least one rower, and the rowers must be one missionary and one cannibal.

Wait, but if only one missionary and one cannibal can row, does that mean that only these two specific individuals can row, and no one else? Or does it mean that any one missionary and any one cannibal can row?

I think it's the latter: any one missionary and any one cannibal can row the boat.

So, for the boat to cross the river, there must be at least one rower, and the rowers must consist of one missionary and one cannibal.

Also, the boat can carry at most two people, including the rowers.

So, if the boat has two people, one must be a rower, but the other one can be anyone, as long as the constraints are satisfied.

Wait, no. Actually, since the boat needs rowers to cross, and only specific combinations can row, I need to make sure that there are rowers on the boat.

Wait, but the problem says "only one missionary and one cannibal can row," but it doesn't specify that they have to be on the boat together to row.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify this.

Let me read the problem again:

"Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. Additionally, someone must row on the boat, and only one missionary and one cannibal can row."

So, it says "only one missionary and one cannibal can row." Does that mean that rowing requires one missionary and one cannibal to be on the boat, rowing together? Or does it mean that any one missionary or any one cannibal can row, but only one missionary and one cannibal are allowed to row at a time?

I think it's the former: rowing requires one missionary and one cannibal to be on the boat, and both must row together.

So, for the boat to move, it must have at least one missionary and one cannibal on board, and those two must row together.

But, the boat can carry at most two people, so if there are two people on the boat, they must be one missionary and one cannibal, and they both row.

Wait, but the problem says "only one missionary and one cannibal can row," which seems to suggest that only one missionary and one cannibal are capable of rowing, but in reality, it probably means that any one missionary and any one cannibal can row.

Wait, maybe I should consider that for the boat to move, it needs to have at least one missionary and one cannibal on board, and those specific individuals must be able to row.

But, given that only one missionary and one cannibal can row, perhaps it means that only pairs of one missionary and one cannibal can row.

So, for the boat to cross, it must have at least one missionary and one cannibal who can row.

But, if the boat has two people, they must be one missionary and one cannibal, and both must be able to row.

Wait, that might not be right.

I need to think carefully.

Let me see:

- The boat needs rowers to cross.

- Only one missionary and one cannibal can row.

- The boat can carry at most two people.

- The boat cannot cross empty.

- On either bank, cannibals must not outnumber missionaries.

- On the boat, cannibals must not outnumber missionaries.

So, perhaps the interpretation is that for the boat to move, there must be at least one rower, and the rowers must consist of one missionary and one cannibal.

But, if the boat has two people, they must be one missionary and one cannibal, and both must be rowers.

Wait, but that seems too restrictive.

Alternatively, maybe only one missionary and one cannibal are capable of rowing, and they must be on the boat together to row.

But that seems to suggest that only those two specific individuals can row, which might not make sense in the context.

Wait, maybe "only one missionary and one cannibal can row" means that any combination of one missionary and one cannibal can row the boat.

So, for the boat to move, it must have at least one missionary and one cannibal on board, and those two must row together.

But, if the boat has only one person, it can't row, because it needs both a missionary and a cannibal to row.

Wait, but the boat can't cross with nothing on it, and it needs rowers to cross.

So, perhaps the boat must have at least one missionary and one cannibal to cross.

But, the boat can carry at most two people, so the possible combinations are:

- One missionary and one cannibal.

- Two people: one missionary and one cannibal.

Wait, that's the same.

So, it seems that the boat must have one missionary and one cannibal on board, who will row together.

So, every time the boat crosses, it must have one missionary and one cannibal on board, rowing together.

That seems to be the requirement.

So, the problem simplifies to finding a sequence of crossings where each crossing involves one missionary and one cannibal rowing the boat, and the constraints on the number of missionaries and cannibals on each bank are satisfied.

Wait, but the problem states that there are three missionaries and three cannibals, and they all need to cross from bank1 to bank2.

So, if each time one missionary and one cannibal must be on the boat, then each crossing transports one missionary and one cannibal.

But, we have three of each, so it would take three crossings to transport all of them.

But, we need to ensure that at no point on either bank do cannibals outnumber missionaries.

Let me think about this.

Initial state:

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat is at bank1.

First crossing:

- One missionary and one cannibal go from bank1 to bank2.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- Boat is at bank2.

This satisfies the constraints: on bank1, missionaries and cannibals are equal; on bank2, they are equal.

Second crossing:

- Now, from bank2, one missionary and one cannibal must return to bank1.

- But wait, the problem says that the boat cannot cross with nothing on it, and it needs rowers.

- So, to return, one missionary and one cannibal must row back to bank1.

- But, if they row back, then bank2 would have 0 missionaries and 0 cannibals.

- But, the boat cannot cross empty, and it needs rowers.

- So, perhaps instead of returning, we need to send another pair.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps after the first crossing, where one missionary and one cannibal go to bank2, then from bank2, one of them rows back to bank1.

But, the problem says that only one missionary and one cannibal can row.

So, if only one rows back, and it has to be one missionary and one cannibal, but if only one rows back, that might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps the rowers must be one missionary and one cannibal together.

So, for each crossing, one missionary and one cannibal must be on the boat, rowing together.

So, in the first crossing, one missionary and one cannibal row the boat to bank2.

Then, for the return trip, one missionary and one cannibal must row the boat back to bank1.

But, on bank2, there is one missionary and one cannibal.

So, if both row back, then bank2 would be empty again.

But, we need to have people on bank2.

This seems problematic.

Alternatively, perhaps the rowers can stay on the bank after crossing.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that the rowers have to return or not.

Perhaps, after crossing, the rowers can stay on the bank.

So, in the first crossing, one missionary and one cannibal row the boat to bank2, and stay there.

Then, for the next crossing, another missionary and another cannibal row the boat from bank1 to bank2.

But, in this case, after three crossings, all missionaries and cannibals would be on bank2.

But, we need to ensure that at no time on either bank do cannibals outnumber missionaries.

Let's see:

First crossing:

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

Second crossing:

- One missionary and one cannibal row from bank1 to bank2

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

Third crossing:

- One missionary and one cannibal row from bank1 to bank2

- Bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

This seems straightforward, and at no point do cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank.

But, is this the only solution?

Or is there a more efficient way?

Wait, but the problem just asks for any plan to get all missionaries and cannibals from bank1 to bank2, so this seems acceptable.

But, perhaps there are variations or additional constraints I'm missing.

Also, the problem mentions that the boat's capacity is 2, which matches with having one missionary and one cannibal on board each time.

But, to make sure, let me think about whether there are any other constraints or possible pitfalls.

One thing to consider is that on the boat, cannibals must not outnumber missionaries; otherwise, the missionaries will be eaten.

But, in this plan, on each crossing, there is one missionary and one cannibal on the boat, so missionaries are never outnumbered.

Similarly, on both banks, after each crossing, the number of missionaries and cannibals is equal, so missionaries are never outnumbered.

Therefore, this plan seems valid.

Alternatively, perhaps there are other ways to achieve the same result with more crossings, but this seems the most straightforward.

So, to summarize, the plan is:

1. One missionary and one cannibal row from bank1 to bank2.

2. One missionary and one cannibal row from bank1 to bank2.

3. One missionary and one cannibal row from bank1 to bank2.

After these three crossings, all missionaries and cannibals are on bank2, and at no point are missionaries outnumbered by cannibals on either bank or on the boat.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Transport one missionary and one cannibal in each of the three crossings.}} \]
