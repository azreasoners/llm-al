Here's a step-by-step solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, adhering to the given constraints:

Initial State:

bank1: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat
bank2: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
Moves (M = Missionary, C = Cannibal):

bank1 to bank2: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal (1M, 1C)

bank1: 2M, 2C
bank2: 1M, 1C, Boat
bank2 to bank1: 1 Missionary (1M)

bank1: 3M, 2C, Boat
bank2: 0M, 1C
bank1 to bank2: 2 Cannibals (2C)

bank1: 3M, 0C
bank2: 0M, 3C, Boat
bank2 to bank1: 1 Cannibal (1C)

bank1: 3M, 1C, Boat
bank2: 0M, 2C
bank1 to bank2: 2 Missionaries (2M)

bank1: 1M, 1C
bank2: 2M, 2C, Boat
bank2 to bank1: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal (1M, 1C)

bank1: 2M, 2C, Boat
bank2: 1M, 1C
bank1 to bank2: 2 Missionaries (2M)

bank1: 0M, 2C
bank2: 3M, 1C, Boat
bank2 to bank1: 1 Cannibal (1C)

bank1: 0M, 3C, Boat
bank2: 3M, 0C
bank1 to bank2: 2 Cannibals (2C)

bank1: 0M, 1C
bank2: 3M, 2C, Boat
bank2 to bank1: 1 Cannibal (1C)

bank1: 0M, 2C, Boat
bank2: 3M, 1C
bank1 to bank2: 2 Cannibals (2C)

bank1: 0M, 0C
bank2: 3M, 3C, Boat
Final State:

bank1: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
bank2: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat
This sequence of moves ensures that at no point do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank or in the boat. It also adheres to the boat's capacity and the requirement that someone must row.
