Here's a breakdown of the problem, how to represent it in your defined system, and a solution plan, along with considerations on how to automate the solving process.

Representing the Problem

State: A state of the world would consist of:

The location of the boat (bank1 or bank2)
The number of missionaries and cannibals on each bank
Identify who is on the boat if it's currently in transit
Initial State:

boat: vessel at location bank1
missionaries: basicGroup with integer 3 at location bank1
cannibals: basicGroup with integer 3 at location bank1
rowers: basicGroup with integer 0 (nobody on the boat initially)
Goal State:

boat: vessel at location bank2
missionaries: basicGroup with integer 3 at location bank2
cannibals: basicGroup with integer 3 at location bank2
Actions/Operators:

Move Boat (who rows, how many passengers): This operator changes the location of the boat and alters the contents of missionaries/cannibals on each bank. Conditions:
A rower (one cannibal or one missionary) must be on board.
The boat cannot exceed its capacity (2).
Cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries on either bank after the move.
Solution Plan

Here's a possible sequence of steps to solve the puzzle:

Send two cannibals across (one rows):
State Change:
Boat at bank2
Missionaries on bank1: 3
Cannibals on bank1: 1
Missionaries on bank2: 0
Cannibals on bank2: 2
Rowers (on boat): 1 cannibal
One cannibal returns:
State Change:
Boat at bank1
Missionaries on bank1: 3
Cannibals on bank1: 2
Missionaries on bank2: 0
Cannibals on bank2: 1
Rowers (on boat): 1 cannibal
Two missionaries cross:
State Change:
Boat at bank2
Missionaries on bank1: 1
Cannibals on bank1: 2
Missionaries on bank2: 2
Cannibals on bank2: 1
Rowers (on boat): 2 missionaries
One missionary and one cannibal return:
State Change:
Boat at bank1
Missionaries on bank1: 2
Cannibals on bank1: 3
Missionaries on bank2: 1
Cannibals on bank2: 0
Rowers (on boat): 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
Two cannibals cross:
State Change:
Boat at bank2
Missionaries on bank1: 2
Cannibals on bank1: 1
Missionaries on bank2: 1
Cannibals on bank2: 2
Rowers (on boat): 2 cannibals
One cannibal returns:
State Change:
Boat at bank1
Missionaries on bank1: 2
Cannibals on bank1: 2
Missionaries on bank2: 1
Cannibals on bank2: 1
Rowers (on boat): 1 cannibal
Two missionaries cross:
State Change:
Boat at bank2
Missionaries on bank1: 0
Cannibals on bank1: 2
Missionaries on bank2: 3
Cannibals on bank2: 1
Rowers (on boat): 2 missionaries
One cannibal returns:
State Change:
Boat at bank1
Missionaries on bank1: 0
Cannibals on bank1: 3
Missionaries on bank2: 3
Cannibals on bank2: 0
Rowers (on boat): 1 cannibal
The last two cannibals cross:
State Change:
Boat at bank2
Missionaries on bank1: 0
Cannibals on bank1: 0
Missionaries on bank2: 3
Cannibals on bank2: 3
Rowers (on boat): 2 cannibals
Automation

You could automate finding a solution using search algorithms like:

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explore possible states systematically.
A*: Incorporate heuristics (e.g., minimizing cannibals on a side with missionaries) to guide the search.
Let me know if you'd like a breakdown of how to implement those!
