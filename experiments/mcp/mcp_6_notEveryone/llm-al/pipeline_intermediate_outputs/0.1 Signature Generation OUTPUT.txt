Actions:
cross(boat) - The action of the boat crossing the river.

Constants:
numAt(BG,P) - The number of members of basicGroup BG at place P. This is an additive fluent representing the count of missionaries and cannibals at each place (bank or boat).
numCrossing(V,BG) - The number of members of basicGroup BG crossing on vessel V during a cross action. This is an attribute of the cross action.
rower(V,BG) - Indicates whether a member of basicGroup BG is rowing vessel V during a cross action. This is a boolean attribute of the cross action.
boatLoc - The location of the boat. This is an inertial fluent indicating the boat's current location (bank1 or bank2).
capacity(V) - The capacity of vessel V. This is a constant representing how many people the vessel can hold.
