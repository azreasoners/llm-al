Here's a plan to safely transport all the missionaries and cannibals from bank1 to bank2 using the boat and the bridge:

2 cannibals cross the river using the bridge. (bank1: 5M, 3C; bank2: 2C)
1 cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1 using the bridge. (bank1: 5M, 4C; bank2: 1C)
2 missionaries cross the river using the boat. (bank1: 3M, 4C; bank2: 2M, 1C)
1 missionary and 1 cannibal return from bank2 to bank1 using the boat. (bank1: 4M, 5C; bank2: 1M)
2 cannibals cross the river using the bridge. (bank1: 4M, 3C; bank2: 1M, 2C)
1 cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1 using the bridge. (bank1: 4M, 4C; bank2: 1M, 1C)
2 missionaries cross the river using the boat. (bank1: 2M, 4C; bank2: 3M, 1C)
1 missionary and 1 cannibal return from bank2 to bank1 using the boat. (bank1: 3M, 5C; bank2: 2M)
2 cannibals cross the river using the bridge. (bank1: 3M, 3C; bank2: 2M, 2C)
1 missionary and 1 cannibal cross the river using the boat. (bank1: 2M, 2C; bank2: 3M, 3C)
2 cannibals return from bank2 to bank1 using the bridge. (bank1: 2M, 4C; bank2: 3M, 1C)
2 missionaries cross the river using the boat. (bank1: 4C; bank2: 5M, 1C)
1 cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1 using the bridge. (bank1: 1C, 4C; bank2: 5M)
2 cannibals cross the river using the boat. (bank1: 3C; bank2: 5M, 2C)
1 cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1 using the bridge. (bank1: 4C; bank2: 5M, 1C)
2 cannibals cross the river using the boat. (bank1: 2C; bank2: 5M, 3C)
2 cannibals cross the river using the bridge. (bank1: 0; bank2: 5M, 5C)

At the end of this plan, all missionaries and cannibals are safely on bank2, and at no point during the process do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
