To solve the problem of safely transporting five missionaries and five cannibals across the river using a boat and a bridge, while adhering to the constraints, we can break down the strategy into a series of moves. Each move must ensure that at no time do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries either on the boat, the bridge, or on either bank of the river.

Key Constraints:
Boat carries a maximum of two people.
Boat cannot be empty when crossing.
Cannibals may not outnumber missionaries on the boat, the bridge, or on either riverbank.
Boat and bridge cannot be used simultaneously.
Bridge can transport two people but cannot be used alone.
Strategy Outline:
Initial Setup: All five missionaries and five cannibals are on bank1.
Phase 1: Boat Usage
Send two cannibals to bank2 (Boat: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals).
One cannibal returns to bank1 (Boat: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal).
Send two cannibals to bank2 (Boat: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals).
One cannibal returns to bank1 (Boat: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal).
Send two missionaries to bank2 (Boat: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals).
One missionary and one cannibal return to bank1 (Boat: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal).
Send two missionaries to bank2 (Boat: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals).
One cannibal returns to bank1 (Boat: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal).
State at this point: On bank2 there are four missionaries and three cannibals. On bank1, there is one missionary and two cannibals.
Phase 2: Bridge Usage
Two missionaries cross the bridge to bank2.
State at this point: On bank2, there are six missionaries and three cannibals. On bank1, there is one missionary and two cannibals.
Phase 3: Final Boat Use
Send two cannibals to bank2 (Boat: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals).
One cannibal returns to bank1 (Boat: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal).
Send the last missionary and cannibal to bank2 (Boat: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal).
Final State:
All five missionaries and five cannibals are safely transported to bank2, with no point at which cannibals outnumber missionaries on either side of the river or on the transport means.

This strategy carefully balances each move to comply with all constraints and safely transport all individuals across the river.
