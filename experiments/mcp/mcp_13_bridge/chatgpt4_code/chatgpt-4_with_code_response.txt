It seems that the program did not find a solution to the problem. I'll make some adjustments to the code to see if there are any issues with the way state transitions or conditions are being checked, and try to solve the problem again. ​​

The program still did not find a solution. I will review and modify the logic to handle the problem's constraints more effectively, including verifying transitions and conditions. Let's try a different approach to find a viable solution. ​​

Despite several adjustments, the program is still not producing a solution. This suggests there might be deeper issues with the state transition logic or the constraints imposed by the problem might be too stringent for the current approach. Let's simplify and try a broader approach that can help identify where the solution pathway might be breaking down. ​​

The problem remains unsolved with the updated logic. This indicates there might be fundamental issues with the setup or additional complexities that need addressing, possibly related to the constraints on movements and ensuring safety. I will revisit the problem with a fresh perspective to check all assumptions and constraints applied, then adjust the code accordingly. Let's attempt a more robust debugging approach to trace potential paths and identify where the logic might be failing. ​​

Despite the debugging attempt and further adjustments to track transitions and validate safety conditions, the program still hasn't produced a solution. This result suggests that either the solution approach might be incorrect or that there is a more subtle flaw in the way state transitions or conditions are being checked.

I'll revisit the logic from the beginning and ensure that all movements, transitions, and conditions strictly align with the problem's requirements. Additionally, I might consider simplifying or restructuring the problem-solving approach if necessary. Let's take one more attempt to debug and refine the solution. ​​

Despite numerous attempts and extensive revisions, the program remains unable to find a solution. This suggests a possibility of a conceptual mismatch in handling the problem constraints or in the setup of transitions, particularly given the complexity of ensuring safety conditions and managing valid moves.

At this point, I recommend reviewing the problem's constraints and requirements comprehensively or trying an entirely different method, possibly using more sophisticated state management or heuristic search strategies such as A* if the problem's constraints are correctly implemented in the current logic framework.

If you'd like, I can help explore these alternative approaches or assist with other questions or problems you might have. ​
