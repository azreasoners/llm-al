% Generated constraints

% Crossing causes the boat to be at the other bank.
cross(NM, NC) causes boatAt = Loc2 if boatAt = Loc1 & ((Loc1 = bank1 & Loc2 = bank2) | (Loc1 = bank2 & Loc2 = bank1)).

% Crossing decrements the number of missionaries and cannibals at the departing bank.
cross(NM, NC) decrements numAt(missionaries, boatAt) by NM.
cross(NM, NC) decrements numAt(cannibals, boatAt) by NC.

% Crossing increments the number of missionaries and cannibals at the arriving bank.
cross(NM, NC) increments numAt(missionaries, Loc2) by NM if boatAt = Loc1 & ((Loc1 = bank1 & Loc2 = bank2) | (Loc1 = bank2 & Loc2 = bank1)).
cross(NM, NC) increments numAt(cannibals, Loc2) by NC if boatAt = Loc1 & ((Loc1 = bank1 & Loc2 = bank2) | (Loc1 = bank2 & Loc2 = bank1)).

% Constraints/Non-executable actions

% Crossing is not executable if the total number crossing is zero.
nonexecutable cross(NM, NC) if NM + NC = 0.

% Crossing is not executable if the total number crossing exceeds 2.
nonexecutable cross(NM, NC) if NM + NC > 2.

% Crossing is not executable if NM or NC is negative.
nonexecutable cross(NM, NC) if NM < 0.
nonexecutable cross(NM, NC) if NC < 0.

% Crossing is not executable if the number of missionaries crossing exceeds the number at the departing bank.
nonexecutable cross(NM, NC) if NM > N & N = numAt(missionaries, boatAt).

% Similarly for cannibals.
nonexecutable cross(NM, NC) if NC > N & N = numAt(cannibals, boatAt).

% Crossing is not executable if missionaries attempt to cross alone (missionaries cannot row).
nonexecutable cross(NM, NC) if NM > 0 & NC = 0.

% Crossing is not executable if cannibals outnumber missionaries on the boat (unless no missionaries are crossing).
nonexecutable cross(NM, NC) if NC > NM & NM > 0.

% Cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries on any bank unless there are no missionaries on that bank.
always numAt(cannibals, Loc) <= numAt(missionaries, Loc) | numAt(missionaries, Loc) = 0.
