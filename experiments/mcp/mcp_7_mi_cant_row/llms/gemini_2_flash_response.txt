Here's a solution to the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem, expressed using your defined types:

Initial State:

boat: at bank1
bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Moves (expressed as who is in the boat crossing from one bank to the other):

Move 1: 2 cannibals (from bank1 to bank2)

boat: at bank2
bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 2: 1 cannibal (from bank2 to bank1)

boat: at bank1
bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 3: 2 cannibals (from bank1 to bank2)

boat: at bank2
bank1: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Move 4: 1 cannibal (from bank2 to bank1)

boat: at bank1
bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 5: 2 missionaries (from bank1 to bank2)

boat: at bank2
bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 6: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal (from bank2 to bank1)

boat: at bank1
bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
Move 7: 2 missionaries (from bank1 to bank2)

boat: at bank2
bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 8: 1 cannibal (from bank2 to bank1)

boat: at bank1
bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Move 9: 2 cannibals (from bank1 to bank2)

boat: at bank2
bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 10: 1 cannibal (from bank2 to bank1)

boat: at bank1
bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 11: 2 cannibals (from bank1 to bank2)

boat: at bank2
bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Final State:

boat: at bank2
bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
This sequence of moves ensures that at no point do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
