This is a classic river crossing puzzle, and we need to solve it while adhering to the constraints provided. Let's break down the problem and create a plan to move all missionaries and cannibals from `bank1` to `bank2` without violating the rules.

### Problem Setup:
- **Entities**:
  - Vessel: `boat` (can carry at most 2 people, cannot cross empty, and missionaries cannot row).
  - Locations: `bank1` (starting side), `bank2` (destination side).
  - Groups: `missionaries` (3 total), `cannibals` (3 total).
  - Integers: 0 to 10 (used to count the number of missionaries and cannibals at each location or in the boat).

- **Initial State**:
  - At `bank1`: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, and the boat.
  - At `bank2`: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals.

- **Goal State**:
  - At `bank1`: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals.
  - At `bank2`: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, and the boat.

- **Constraints**:
  1. The boat can carry at most 2 people at once.
  2. The boat cannot cross the river empty.
  3. Missionaries cannot row, so at least one cannibal must be in the boat to row.
  4. Cannibals must not outnumber missionaries on either bank (or missionaries will be eaten).
  5. Cannibals must not outnumber missionaries in the boat (or missionaries will be eaten).

### Notation:
- Let `(M1, C1, B)` represent the state at `bank1`, where:
  - `M1` = number of missionaries at `bank1`.
  - `C1` = number of cannibals at `bank1`.
  - `B` = 1 if the boat is at `bank1`, 0 if the boat is at `bank2`.
- The state at `bank2` is implicitly `(3 - M1, 3 - C1, 1 - B)`.
- A move is represented as `(m, c) ->`, where:
  - `m` = number of missionaries in the boat.
  - `c` = number of cannibals in the boat.
  - `->` indicates the direction of the boat (from `bank1` to `bank2` or vice versa).

### Constraints in Detail:
1. **Boat capacity**: \( m + c \leq 2 \) and \( m + c \geq 1 \) (boat cannot be empty).
2. **Missionaries cannot row**: \( c \geq 1 \) (at least one cannibal must be in the boat).
3. **Cannibals must not outnumber missionaries in the boat**: If \( m > 0 \), then \( c \leq m \).
4. **Cannibals must not outnumber missionaries on either bank**:
   - At `bank1` after a move: \( M1 - m = 0 \) or \( M1 - m \geq C1 - c \).
   - At `bank2` after a move: \( 3 - M1 + m = 0 \) or \( 3 - M1 + m \geq 3 - C1 + c \).

### Solution Plan:
We will find a sequence of valid moves that transitions from the initial state `(3, 3, 1)` to the goal state `(0, 0, 0)` (where all missionaries and cannibals are at `bank2`).

#### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Initial State**: `(3, 3, 1)` (3M, 3C, boat at `bank1`).
   - At `bank1`: 3M, 3C.
   - At `bank2`: 0M, 0C.

2. **Move 1**: `(0, 2) ->` (2 cannibals cross from `bank1` to `bank2`).
   - New state: `(3, 1, 0)`.
   - At `bank1`: 3M, 1C.
   - At `bank2`: 0M, 2C, boat.

3. **Move 2**: `(0, 1) <-` (1 cannibal returns from `bank2` to `bank1`).
   - New state: `(3, 2, 1)`.
   - At `bank1`: 3M, 2C, boat.
   - At `bank2`: 0M, 1C.

4. **Move 3**: `(0, 2) ->` (2 cannibals cross from `bank1` to `bank2`).
   - New state: `(3, 0, 0)`.
   - At `bank1`: 3M, 0C.
   - At `bank2`: 0M, 3C, boat.

5. **Move 4**: `(0, 1) <-` (1 cannibal returns from `bank2` to `bank1`).
   - New state: `(3, 1, 1)`.
   - At `bank1`: 3M, 1C, boat.
   - At `bank2`: 0M, 2C.

6. **Move 5**: `(1, 1) ->` (1 missionary and 1 cannibal cross from `bank1` to `bank2`).
   - New state: `(2, 0, 0)`.
   - At `bank1`: 2M, 0C.
   - At `bank2`: 1M, 3C, boat.

7. **Move 6**: `(0, 1) <-` (1 cannibal returns from `bank2` to `bank1`).
   - New state: `(2, 1, 1)`.
   - At `bank1`: 2M, 1C, boat.
   - At `bank2`: 1M, 2C.

8. **Move 7**: `(2, 0) ->` (2 missionaries cross from `bank1` to `bank2`).
   - New state: `(0, 1, 0)`.
   - At `bank1`: 0M, 1C.
   - At `bank2`: 3M, 2C, boat.

9. **Move 8**: `(0, 1) <-` (1 cannibal returns from `bank2` to `bank1`).
   - New state: `(0, 2, 1)`.
   - At `bank1`: 0M, 2C, boat.
   - At `bank2`: 3M, 1C.

10. **Move 9**: `(0, 2) ->` (2 cannibals cross from `bank1` to `bank2`).
    - New state: `(0, 0, 0)`.
    - At `bank1`: 0M, 0C.
    - At `bank2`: 3M, 3C, boat.

### Final State:
- All missionaries and cannibals are at `bank2`, and the boat is at `bank2`.
- Goal achieved: `(0, 0, 0)`.

### Verification:
- At each step, the constraints are satisfied:
  - The boat carries at most 2 people and is never empty.
  - At least one cannibal is in the boat (since missionaries cannot row).
  - Cannibals never outnumber missionaries in the boat or on either bank.

This plan successfully solves the problem.
