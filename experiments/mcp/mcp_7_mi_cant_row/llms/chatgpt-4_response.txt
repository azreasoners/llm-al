To solve the problem of moving three missionaries and three cannibals from one bank of a river (bank1) to the other side (bank2) using a boat that can carry at most two people at once, while ensuring that the cannibals never outnumber the missionaries on either bank or on the boat, you can follow this sequence of moves:

Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.
One cannibal returns to bank1.
Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2 again.
One cannibal returns to bank1.
Two missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2.
One missionary and one cannibal return to bank1.
Two missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2.
One cannibal returns to bank2.
Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.
One cannibal returns to bank1.
Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.
Now let's detail the transitions and checks to ensure the conditions are satisfied:

Initial State:
Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, boat
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Step 1:
Move: 2 cannibals cross to bank2
Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Step 2:
Move: 1 cannibal returns to bank1
Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Step 3:
Move: 2 cannibals cross to bank2
Bank1: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Step 4:
Move: 1 cannibal returns to bank1
Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Step 5:
Move: 2 missionaries cross to bank2
Bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Step 6:
Move: 1 missionary and 1 cannibal return to bank1
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
Step 7:
Move: 2 missionaries cross to bank2
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Step 8:
Move: 1 cannibal crosses to bank2
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Step 9:
Move: 2 cannibals cross to bank2
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Step 10:
Move: 1 cannibal returns to bank1
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Step 11:
Move: 2 cannibals cross to bank2
Final Bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Final Bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Each step ensures that the cannibals never outnumber the missionaries on either bank or on the boat at any time.
