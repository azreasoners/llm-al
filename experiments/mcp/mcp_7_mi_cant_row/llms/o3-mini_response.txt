Thought about missionary-cannibal river crossing for 1m 12s
Mapping the constraints

I’m thinking through a puzzle involving moving 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals across a river using a boat without ever having more cannibals than missionaries on either bank or the boat. This involves strategic planning to ensure safety.

Assessing boat loads

I'm considering valid boat loads: 1 missionary, 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal, 2 cannibals, or 1 missionary + 1 cannibal. No missionaries are fine if cannibals outnumber.

Creating a step plan

I’m detailing the sequence of moving 2 cannibals at a time, returning 1 cannibal, then 2 cannibals again, ensuring no missionaries are outnumbered. Progress is steady and consistent.

Moving missionaries

OK, let me see: I’m transporting 2 missionaries to bank2, shifting 1 back to bank1, and finally, moving 2 missionaries to bank2, ensuring everyone's safety.

Checking the plan

I’m noting each move to ensure cannibals never outnumber missionaries on the boat, even when no missionaries are present. It’s interesting to see the plan refine step-by-step.

Refining the plan

I’m gathering details for a clear sequence of boat trips, ensuring no missionaries are outnumbered by cannibals, and refining the steps for each move.

Ensuring safety

I'm verifying each boat trip to confirm no missionaries are outnumbered by cannibals, even in cases with multiple cannibals aboard. Each journey is carefully considered for safety.

Mapping boat trips

OK, let's see. The rule "missionaries cannot row" suggests that each boat trip must have at least one cannibal to operate the boat. This will affect future journey planning.

Tweaking the approach

Taking a closer look: each boat trip now includes at least one cannibal. This adjustment ensures valid crossings, maintaining missionary safety throughout the journey.

Ensuring safety

OK, let me see. I’m adjusting the plan to include a cannibal in every boat trip. This maintains missionary safety, consistent with classic solutions and the new constraints.

Crafting the approach

I’m testing different boat trip configurations to avoid unsafe scenarios. Each setup ensures cannibals don’t outnumber missionaries, keeping their crossings safe and optimal.

Revising the strategy

I'm working through boat movements while keeping safety intact. Each trip now must include at least one cannibal to avoid unsafe situations. Progress is steady and thoughtful.

Ensuring safety

Mapping out moves to keep cannibals from outnumbering missionaries. Each trip must include at least one cannibal to meet safety guidelines. Progressing through these steps ensures effective planning.

Revisiting strategies

It's crucial to rethink the return method. Ensuring safe crossing and cannibal balance requires careful consideration of each step and possible adjustments.

Optimizing strategy

I'm figuring out the best way to balance missionaries and cannibals on each side. Precise boat trips are crafted to keep the cannibals from overwhelming the missionaries.

Revisiting strategy

Balancing missionaries and cannibals, including a cannibal-free trip, to prevent unsafe boat trips and keep the course steady and safe.

Calibrating the approach

OK, let me see. Launching two cannibals first ensures safety on both banks. Only then can we move missionaries without risk for a smooth journey.

Rethinking the strategy

Taking a closer look at the balance of the plan, including a cannibal-free boat trip, ensures the safety of both missionaries and cannibals throughout the journey.

Transferring safely

I'm thinking through how to move missionaries with cannibals, making sure the boat isn't empty and transfers are safe. Progress is steady and thoughtful, guiding toward a secure solution.

Refining the strategy

Maximizing initial transfers to manage safe crossings later. I'm focusing on placing missionaries and cannibals on bank2 to prevent cannibal overpowers. Progress is steady and thoughtful.

Weighing options

Transferring two cannibals first works well, considering potential returns and minimizing safety risks until all are successfully moved.

Weighing the choices

OK, let's consider how to transfer missionaries with cannibals, ensuring safe crossings. Transfers must avoid leaving missionaries at risk of being outnumbered by cannibals.

Crafting effective moves

I'm evaluating first-move strategies to ensure safe crossings. Considering (1 cannibal) alone initially. However, without a return strategy, it might just end up at the initial state.

Balancing transfers

I’m working through a sequence: starting with (1 missionary, 1 cannibal) to bank2, then returning a cannibal. This keeps the crossings and safety balanced.

Balancing crossings

I’m working through sequences of moves to ensure safe crossings. By sending two cannibals together, then skillfully managing returns, progress towards a solution is balanced and achievable.

Navigating sequences

Piecing together moves to ensure safe crossings, I’m thinking through various sequences to find the best route that balances efficiency and safety effectively.

Balancing strategies

I’m iterating through different sequences to ensure safe crossings. By gradually moving missionaries and cannibals, I aim to prevent unsafe imbalances and progress towards a solution.

Ensuring safe crossings

By initially sending (1M,1C) to bank2, safety is maintained with a balanced or pre-occupied boat. This approach ensures a safer crossing strategy.

Marveling at the strategy

Taking a closer look, I’m testing different combinations to ensure safe crossings without any unsafe character imbalances. This method gradually builds upon established testing patterns.

Trying another way

Testing different paths like (3,0) to (0,3) and (2,2) to (1,1) to ensure all crossings are safe and balanced. Progress is being made through iterative testing.

Revisiting initial moves

I'm mapping out combinations like (2C) and (1M,1C), noting their issues. Also, I'm considering literature on the unsolvable variant for 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals.

Dealing with a tricky setup

Interestingly enough, the standard solution for 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals doesn't work when only cannibals row. This setup highlights the challenge of boat allocation.

Analyzing the challenge

Given the constraint that cannibals can row but missionaries cannot, I conclude the problem is unsolvable for 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals with these conditions.

Evaluating boat stability

Hmm, I’m thinking about possible moves: solo cannibal crossing, missionary and cannibal together, or two cannibals. Each scenario needs a cannibal in the boat to maintain balance.

Evaluating strategies

I'm detailing three crossing methods: solo cannibal, combined missionary-cannibal, and dual cannibals. The aim is to ensure balance and safety under the stated conditions.

Troubling loop

OK, let me see. Initiating the (M, C) route arrives at (2,3, L). Progress stumbles since only cannibals can row, yet missionaries steer the boat. Progress halts.

Analyzing return strategies

Mapping out initial moves from (3,1, R) to (3,0, R) and (3,1, R) to (3,2, L), I’m thinking through the safest ways to return and maintain balance.

Evaluating potential paths

Assesing if (3,0, R) works, I notice cannibals outnumber missionaries by one. Considering (3,1, R), but it’s too safe—returning with just a cannibal creates a loop.

Assessing choices

I'm evaluating moves like transporting a solo cannibal, which results in a loop, or opting for two cannibals. The aim is to ensure a balanced and safe approach.

Reevaluating options

I’m rethinking the (3,3, L) state and exploring alternative methods. Ultimately, it seems no sequence guarantees safe missionaries' transfer without breaking balance. Fascinating progression here.

Navigating uncertainties

OK, I’m thinking through the situation and it seems impossible to ensure the missionaries' safety while adhering to the rule that only the can allow row the boat.

Adjusting my approach

I'm thinking through various methods to transfer the missionaries safely. Despite multiple attempts, finding a viable sequence that ensures their safety remains elusive. Progress is gradually being made.

Taking a closer look

For 3 missionaries and 2 cannibals, with only cannibals rowing, a solution is impossible. The classic problem solution hinges on either group rowing.

Assessing unique constraints

OK, let me see. A boat needing a cannibal to row prompts a stark imbalance, making it impossible to transport three missionaries and three cannibals safely.

Considering passenger options

I’m thinking it might work if missionaries shuttle between two groups, so the boat always has a rower and avoids mission imbalance.

Reevaluating the dynamics

I’m rethinking the setup: missionaries can't row solo but can be passengers if a cannibal rows. This means any valid move must include at least one cannibal.

Confirming constraints

It's interesting to see that only moves with a cannibal are allowed since missionaries can't row alone. This leads me to conclude that no valid sequence exists under these rules.

Deciphering boat rules

OK, let's break it down: each crossing needs at least one cannibal. No valid sequence for missionaries alone (M=M=0 boats) lasts for three crossings.

Mapping potential moves

I'm working through various boat crossings, considering safe ones like (C), (M,C), and identifying any unsafe states like (2,3,L). This way, only safe states are analyzed.

Assessing potential options

I’m considering Option C, which involves cannibals rowing together. Unsurprisingly, this results in cyclic states without making progress towards the goal. These cyclic states are non-productive.

We will show that if the following four conditions must hold, then no sequence of moves (“plan”) can get all three missionaries and all three cannibals safely from bank1 to bank2. In our problem the “things” are of four types:

vessel: the boat
locations: bank1 and bank2
groups: “missionaries” and “cannibals”
integers: the numbers 0, 1, 2, … etc.
The rules are:

The boat (a vessel) can carry at most two people (individuals come from the groups “missionaries” and “cannibals”).
The boat cannot cross the river empty.
On either bank (a location), if any missionaries are present then their number must be at least as great as the number of cannibals; otherwise the cannibals will eat the missionaries.
On the boat itself the same safety condition applies: if a missionary is present then the number of cannibals aboard must not exceed the number of missionaries.
Missionaries cannot row. (Only cannibals are capable of operating—the “vessel” must have at least one cannibal aboard on every crossing.)
A “move” is a boat crossing in which a group of one or two people is carried from one bank to the other subject to the following extra restriction: since only cannibals can row, every crossing must include at least one cannibal.

Thus, the only allowed boat loads are:

a single cannibal,
two cannibals, or
one missionary together with one cannibal.
Many people know that the classic missionaries and cannibals problem (with a boat of capacity 2) has a solution if anyone may row. However, if only cannibals may row (so that moves of two missionaries are not allowed, and any move that transfers a missionary must include a cannibal) then the list of allowed moves is strictly limited.

A brief analysis shows that we must “start” by sending one of the allowed loads from bank1 (where we initially have 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals) to bank2. (We will denote a state by (M, C, B) meaning “M missionaries and C cannibals at bank1 with the boat (B) on the indicated side; the other bank then has the complementary numbers.”)

Let’s check the possibilities:

A one‐cannibal move from bank1 to bank2:
– Move: (C)
– New state: (3, 2, bank2) on bank1 and (0, 1) on bank2.
The boat is now on bank2. But the only person available to row back from bank2 is a cannibal; returning that cannibal immediately undoes the move. (Any return move simply brings us back to the initial state.)

A (missionary, cannibal) move from bank1 to bank2:
– Move: (M, C)
– New state: (2, 2, bank2) on bank1 and (1, 1) on bank2.
(Both banks are safe because 2 = 2 and 1 = 1.)
However, on bank2 the only possible nonempty return move must include at least one cannibal (since missionaries cannot row). The only option is to send a single cannibal back.
– Return move: (C) from bank2 to bank1
– New state: (2, 3, bank1) and (1, 0, bank2).
Now bank1 is unsafe (2 missionaries and 3 cannibals, and 2 < 3).

A (cannibal, cannibal) move from bank1 to bank2:
– Move: (C, C)
– New state: (3, 1, bank2) on bank1 and (0, 2) on bank2.
The boat is now on bank2. The only available return move is a single cannibal coming back.
– Return move: (C) from bank2 to bank1
– New state: (3, 2, bank1) and (0, 1, bank2).
(This state is “better” than the one reached in case 2, but we still have 3 missionaries waiting on bank1.)

Now, from the state (3, 2, bank1) the only moves are again (C), (M, C), or (C, C). One might try to send (M, C) next (to get a missionary over), but then the state would become (2, 1) on bank1 and (1, 2) on bank2. Unfortunately, on bank2 1 missionary with 2 cannibals is unsafe because the cannibals would outnumber the missionary.

The other allowed move from (3, 2, bank1) is to send another (C, C), which would leave bank1 with (3, 0) and bank2 with (0, 3). Although both banks are safe, no missionaries have been transferred. (And further moves from there again force a cannibal back and leave no net progress.)

A more systematic search over all sequences using only the allowed moves (recall that every crossing must include at least one cannibal) shows that no plan exists that can deliver all three missionaries and all three cannibals safely from bank1 to bank2 without violating one or more of the constraints.

Conclusion
Under the rules stated—that is, with the restrictions

that on each bank the number of cannibals must never exceed the number of missionaries (if any missionaries are present),
that on the boat the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries (if any are present),
and that missionaries cannot row (so every crossing must include at least one cannibal)—
there is no valid sequence of moves (no “plan”) that will bring all three missionaries and all three cannibals from bank1 to bank2 safely.

Answer: No plan exists that satisfies the conditions.
