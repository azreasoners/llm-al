Absolutely! Here's the solution to the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem along with explanations to help you understand the logic behind the steps.

Understanding the Rules

Capacity: The boat can carry a maximum of two people.
Safety on the banks: Cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries on either bank, or the missionaries will be in danger.
Safety on the boat: If, on the boat, cannibals outnumber the missionaries, there's also a risk.
Movement: The boat must have at least one person to cross the river.
Missionaries limitations: Missionaries cannot row the boat.
Representation:

M = Missionary
C = Cannibal
B = Boat
Steps to Solve

CC -> Two cannibals cross the river (bank1: 3M, 1C, B | bank2: 2C)
C <- One cannibal returns (bank1: 3M, 2C | bank2: 1C, B)
CC -> Two cannibals cross again (bank1: 3M, B | bank2: 3C)
C <- One cannibal returns (bank1: 3M, 1C, B | bank2: 2C)
MM -> Two missionaries cross (bank1: 1M, 1C | bank2: 2M, 2C, B)
MC <- One missionary, one cannibal return (bank1: 2M, 2C, B | bank2: 1M, 1C)
MM -> Two missionaries cross (bank1: B | bank2: 3M, 3C, B)
C <- One cannibal returns (bank1: 1C, B | bank2: 3M, 2C)
CC -> Two cannibals cross (bank1: B | bank2: 3M, 3C, B)
C <- One cannibal returns (bank1: 1C, B | bank2: 3M, 2C)
CC -> Two cannibals cross again (bank1: | bank2: 3M, 3C, B)
Success! Now all three missionaries and three cannibals are safely on bank2.
