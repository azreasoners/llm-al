% constraints/rules

% 1. The capacity of the boat is 2.
capacity(boat) = 2.

% 2. Crossing the boat causes the boat and the people to move to NewLoc.
cross(P1, P2) causes loc(boat) = NewLoc & loc(P1) = NewLoc & loc(P2) = NewLoc
    if loc(boat) = Loc & NewLoc \= Loc & loc(P1) = Loc & loc(P2) = Loc.

% 3. The crossing action is not executable if P1 and P2 are not at the same location as the boat.
nonexecutable cross(P1, P2) if loc(P1) \= loc(boat).
nonexecutable cross(P1, P2) if loc(P2) \= loc(boat).

% 4. It is impossible for a person to be at two different locations at the same time.
impossible loc(P) = Loc1 & loc(P) = Loc2 & Loc1 \= Loc2.

% 5. The boat cannot cross with no people.
nonexecutable cross(P1, P2) if P1\=P2 & P1\=P1.

% 6. The counts of missionaries and cannibals are updated when people move.

% For P1
cross(P1, P2) increments num_missionaries(NewLoc) by 1 if P1 = M & M :: missionary & loc(M) = Loc & NewLoc \= Loc.
cross(P1, P2) decrements num_missionaries(Loc) by 1 if P1 = M & M :: missionary & loc(M) = Loc & NewLoc \= Loc.
cross(P1, P2) increments num_cannibals(NewLoc) by 1 if P1 = C & C :: cannibal & loc(C) = Loc & NewLoc \= Loc.
cross(P1, P2) decrements num_cannibals(Loc) by 1 if P1 = C & C :: cannibal & loc(C) = Loc & NewLoc \= Loc.

% For P2
cross(P1, P2) increments num_missionaries(NewLoc) by 1 if P2 = M & M :: missionary & loc(M) = Loc & NewLoc \= Loc.
cross(P1, P2) decrements num_missionaries(Loc) by 1 if P2 = M & M :: missionary & loc(M) = Loc & NewLoc \= Loc.
cross(P1, P2) increments num_cannibals(NewLoc) by 1 if P2 = C & C :: cannibal & loc(C) = Loc & NewLoc \= Loc.
cross(P1, P2) decrements num_cannibals(Loc) by 1 if P2 = C & C :: cannibal & loc(C) = Loc & NewLoc \= Loc.

% 7. It is impossible for the number of cannibals to be greater than the number of missionaries at a location where there is at least one missionary.
impossible N_c > N_m & N_m > 0 & num_cannibals(Loc) = N_c & num_missionaries(Loc) = N_m.

% 8. The cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat.
% We consider the boat's location separately.
impossible N_c > N_m & N_m > 0 & num_cannibals(boat) = N_c & num_missionaries(boat) = N_m.

% 9. The large cannibal cannot be left alone with the small missionary.
impossible loc(big_cannibal) = Loc & loc(small_missionary) = Loc & loc(missionary1) \= Loc & loc(missionary2) \= Loc.

% 10. The boat cannot carry more people than its capacity.
nonexecutable cross(P1, P2) if P1 \= P2 & capacity(boat) < 2.
nonexecutable cross(P1, P2) if P1 = P2 & capacity(boat) < 1.
