Thought about missionaries and cannibals puzzle for 1m 2s
Assessing constraints

I'm considering the dynamics of a large cannibal and a small missionary, ensuring the rules don't lead to the latter's demise. This involves careful planning and vigilance.

Balancing constraints

Ensuring no boat trip leaves cannibals outnumbering missionaries is crucial, and maintaining equal numbers of each on both banks is essential. Progress hinges on these balance regulations.

Charting the course

I’m thinking through the sequence of boat crossings for 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals. Ensuring no side has more cannibals than missionaries is key, especially avoiding scenarios with the large cannibal.

Mapping out the challenge

I’m adjusting the standard 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals puzzle to include the vital restriction: the large cannibal can't be left alone with the small missionary. Progressing towards a solution is interesting.

Evaluating the plan

I'm noting that the standard 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals solution should be adjusted to ensure the large cannibal never interacts with the small missionary alone.

Adjusting the strategy

Piecing together a new approach to dodge violations, like sending 2 missionaries or 2 cannibals upfront, to keep both sides balanced and avert the large cannibal from being alone with the small missionary.

Ensuring safe travel

OK, let me see. It's crucial that the large cannibal never travels alone with the small missionary. To achieve this, I’ll ensure there's always at least one other missionary or cannibal present on both the boat and each bank.

Navigating constraints

I’m figuring out how to ensure equal numbers of missionaries and cannibals on each bank, avoiding the large cannibal being alone with the small missionary on both the boat and any bank.

Ensuring safety

I’m piecing together that keeping the small missionary safe requires avoiding travel with the large cannibal. Also, maintaining a balanced count of cannibals and missionaries on both banks is crucial.

Adjusting my approach

Ensuring no small missionary travels with the large cannibal, and that each bank stays balanced with missionaries and cannibals, is crucial to prevent unsafe situations.

Balancing roles

Ensuring equal missionaries and cannibals on each bank, without the large cannibal being alone with the small missionary, while adhering to the boat's constraints.

Ensuring safety measures

Sending 2 missionaries together keeps the small missionary safe from the large cannibal, and it balances the counts on both banks, fitting the boat's limits.

Ensuring balance

Sending 2 missionaries together bakes in safety for the small missionary, with the boat can't have more cannibals than missionaries. Progressing through these steps, it’s worth noting the constraints.

Balancing constraints

OK, let me see. Returning 1 missionary ensures safety for the small missionary and keeps both sides aligned with the constraints, effectively managing the delicate equilibrium between groups.

Ensuring balance

Returning 1 missionary and 1 cannibal keeps the groups balanced and avoids leaving the small missionary with the large cannibal alone. This method respects the constraints and maintains equilibrium.

Ensuring safety

I’m checking that no small missionary is left alone with the large cannibal on either bank. The small missionary M3 is safely accompanied by another missionary M1.

Balancing constraints

It's interesting to see that no small missionary is left alone with the large cannibal, and the groups are balanced without violating any constraints. Continuation is feasible.

Confirming constraints

I'm ensuring all group dynamics are balanced, with no small missionary alone with the large cannibal on either bank, aligning perfectly with the constraints.

Ensuring safety

I’m noting the groups stay balanced and the small missionary is safe. Evaluating options for the next move, I want to pick the best one.

Balancing the options

Ensuring no small missionary is left alone with the large cannibal is key. Bringing one cannibal back keeps the groups even and safe, respecting all the constraints.

Restoring balance

Bringing C3 back to the left side equalizes the groups, keeps everyone safe, and ensures the small missionary isn't left alone with the large cannibal. Continuity is feasible under these conditions.

Ensuring balance

Placing C3 back to the left side balances the groups, keeping everyone safe and maintaining the crucial missionary-cannibal parity. Progressing through these steps, we achieve equilibrium.

Ensuring progress

Wrapping up by bringing C1 and C2 over. C3 stays on the left while the others cross. The boat must return to transport C3 to the right side.

Ensuring safety and balance

OK, let me see. The boat now sits on the left with all cannibals, while all missionaries are safely over on the right. Progress is steady and secure.

Safely balancing groups

OK, let me see. C1 and C2 are transported to the right. Returning C2 ensures the large cannibal doesn't get left alone with the small missionary.

Aligning groups

Ensuring every group is balanced and safe, I meticulously verify no constraints are broken. Returning C2 keeps everyone secure, achieving the perfect outcome.

Mapping out safety

I'm ensuring the small missionary isn't left alone with the large cannibal, while simultaneously maintaining a balanced count of cannibals and missionaries on both banks.

Below is one systematic solution that respects all the constraints:

The boat can carry at most 2 people.
It cannot travel empty.
On either bank (or on the boat), cannibals must never outnumber missionaries when at least one missionary is present.
The large cannibal (call him 
𝐿
L) must never be alone with the small missionary (call her 
𝑆
S) without anyone else present.
We label our six individuals as follows:

Notation for the moves
A move “

𝑌
→
X,Y→” means 
𝑋
X and 
𝑌
Y go from left to right.
A move “
←
𝑋
,
𝑌
←X,Y” means 
𝑋
X and 
𝑌
Y return from right to left.
If only one person is on the boat, we simply list that person.
We will track (Left bank | Right bank; who’s on the boat) after each step.
