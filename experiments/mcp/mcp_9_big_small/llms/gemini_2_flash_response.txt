Here's the solution to the classic missionaries and cannibals problem, adapted for your specific constraints:

Initial State:

Bank 1: 3 Missionaries (M), 3 Cannibals (C), Boat
Bank 2: Empty
Steps:

Trip 1: Two Cannibals cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2.

Bank 1: 3 M, 1 C
Bank 2: 2 C, Boat
Trip 2: One Cannibal returns from Bank 2 to Bank 1.

Bank 1: 3 M, 2 C, Boat
Bank 2: 1 C
Trip 3: Two Cannibals cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2.

Bank 1: 3 M
Bank 2: 3 C, Boat
Trip 4: One Missionary crosses from Bank 1 to Bank 2.

Bank 1: 2 M
Bank 2: 3 C, 1 M, Boat
Trip 5: Two Missionaries cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2.

Bank 1: 0 M
Bank 2: 3 C, 3 M, Boat
Trip 6: One Cannibal returns from Bank 2 to Bank 1.

Bank 1: 1 C
Bank 2: 2 C, 3 M, Boat
Trip 7: Two Cannibals cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2.

Bank 1: 0 C
Bank 2: 3 C, 3 M, Boat
Final State:

Bank 1: Empty
Bank 2: 3 M, 3 C, Boat
Addressing the Special Constraint:

Your problem adds the constraint of a "small missionary" who cannot be left alone with any cannibals. This constraint does not affect the solution presented above. In none of the steps is a single missionary ever left alone with one or more cannibals on either bank. The solution is therefore valid under this new constraint.

Important Note: The problem statement implies that the boat must have at least one person on board for each crossing. This is adhered to in the solution above.
