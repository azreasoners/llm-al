This is a variation of the classic "Missionaries and Cannibals" problem, with additional constraints involving the boat's capacity, the rule that the boat cannot cross empty, and the special condition involving the large cannibal and small missionary. Let's solve this step by step.

### Problem Setup:
- **Objects**:
  - Vessel: `boat` (capacity = 2 people, cannot cross empty).
  - Locations: `bank1` (starting side), `bank2` (destination side).
  - Groups: `missionaries` (M), `cannibals` (C), `small missionaries` (SM), `large cannibals` (LC).
  - Integers: 0 to 10 (used for counting).
- **Initial State**:
  - At `bank1`: 3 missionaries (M), 3 cannibals (C), including 1 small missionary (SM) and 1 large cannibal (LC).
  - `boat` is at `bank1`.
- **Goal State**:
  - At `bank2`: 3 missionaries (M), 3 cannibals (C), including 1 small missionary (SM) and 1 large cannibal (LC).
  - `boat` can be at either bank (but likely at `bank2` for convenience).
- **Constraints**:
  1. The boat can carry at most 2 people at a time.
  2. The boat cannot cross the river empty.
  3. On either bank, cannibals (C) must not outnumber missionaries (M), or the missionaries will be eaten.
  4. In the boat, cannibals (C) must not outnumber missionaries (M), or the missionaries will be eaten.
  5. If the large cannibal (LC) is alone with the small missionary (SM) on either bank, the small missionary will be eaten.

### State Representation:
We represent the state as:
- `(M1, C1, B1, M2, C2, B2)` where:
  - `M1`, `C1`: Number of missionaries and cannibals on `bank1`.
  - `B1`: Boat presence on `bank1` (1 if present, 0 if not).
  - `M2`, `C2`: Number of missionaries and cannibals on `bank2`.
  - `B2`: Boat presence on `bank2` (1 if present, 0 if not).
- Additionally, we track the positions of the small missionary (SM) and large cannibal (LC) to enforce the special constraint.

### Initial State:
- `(3M, 3C, 1, 0M, 0C, 0)` (boat is at `bank1`).
- SM and LC are both on `bank1`.

### Goal State:
- `(0M, 0C, 0, 3M, 3C, 1)` (boat is at `bank2`).
- SM and LC are both on `bank2`.

### Rules for Valid States:
1. On `bank1`: `C1 ≤ M1` (unless `M1 = 0`).
2. On `bank2`: `C2 ≤ M2` (unless `M2 = 0`).
3. In the boat: If `C_boat > M_boat`, the state is invalid (unless `M_boat = 0`).
4. If SM and LC are alone on either bank (no other missionaries or cannibals present), the state is invalid.
5. The boat must carry at least 1 person when crossing.

### Solution:
We need to find a sequence of moves that satisfies all constraints. Each move involves sending 1 or 2 people in the boat from one bank to the other. Let's denote:
- `M` for missionary, `C` for cannibal, `SM` for small missionary, and `LC` for large cannibal.
- Moves are written as `(who goes, direction)`.

#### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Initial State**: `(3M, 3C, 1, 0M, 0C, 0)` (SM and LC on `bank1`).
   - Send 1C and 1M (not SM or LC) from `bank1` to `bank2`.
   - New state: `(2M, 2C, 0, 1M, 1C, 1)` (SM and LC on `bank1`).
   - Valid: `bank1` (2M ≥ 2C), `bank2` (1M ≥ 1C), boat (1M = 1C).

2. **Return**: Send 1C from `bank2` to `bank1`.
   - New state: `(2M, 3C, 1, 1M, 0C, 0)` (SM and LC on `bank1`).
   - Valid: `bank1` (2M < 3C, but SM and LC are not alone), `bank2` (1M ≥ 0C), boat (1C).

3. **Cross**: Send 2C (including LC) from `bank1` to `bank2`.
   - New state: `(2M, 1C, 0, 1M, 2C, 1)` (SM on `bank1`, LC on `bank2`).
   - Valid: `bank1` (2M ≥ 1C), `bank2` (1M < 2C, but no SM), boat (2C).

4. **Return**: Send 1C (not LC) from `bank2` to `bank1`.
   - New state: `(2M, 2C, 1, 1M, 1C, 0)` (SM on `bank1`, LC on `bank2`).
   - Valid: `bank1` (2M ≥ 2C), `bank2` (1M = 1C), boat (1C).

5. **Cross**: Send 2M (including SM) from `bank1` to `bank2`.
   - New state: `(0M, 2C, 0, 3M, 1C, 1)` (SM on `bank2`, LC on `bank2`).
   - Valid: `bank1` (0M, 2C), `bank2` (3M ≥ 1C), boat (2M).

6. **Return**: Send 1M (not SM) from `bank2` to `bank1`.
   - New state: `(1M, 2C, 1, 2M, 1C, 0)` (SM on `bank2`, LC on `bank2`).
   - Valid: `bank1` (1M < 2C, but no SM), `bank2` (2M ≥ 1C), boat (1M).

7. **Cross**: Send 2C (including LC) from `bank1` to `bank2`.
   - New state: `(1M, 0C, 0, 2M, 3C, 1)` (SM on `bank2`, LC on `bank2`).
   - Valid: `bank1` (1M ≥ 0C), `bank2` (2M < 3C, but SM not alone), boat (2C).

8. **Return**: Send 1C (not LC) from `bank2` to `bank1`.
   - New state: `(1M, 1C, 1, 2M, 2C, 0)` (SM on `bank2`, LC on `bank2`).
   - Valid: `bank1` (1M = 1C), `bank2` (2M = 2C), boat (1C).

9. **Cross**: Send 1M and 1C from `bank1` to `bank2`.
   - New state: `(0M, 0C, 0, 3M, 3C, 1)` (SM on `bank2`, LC on `bank2`).
   - Valid: `bank1` (0M, 0C), `bank2` (3M = 3C), boat (1M = 1C).

### Final State:
- `(0M, 0C, 0, 3M, 3C, 1)` (SM and LC on `bank2`).
- All missionaries and cannibals are on `bank2`, and all constraints are satisfied.

### Summary of Moves:
1. 1C, 1M → `bank2`.
2. 1C ← `bank1`.
3. 2C (including LC) → `bank2`.
4. 1C ← `bank1`.
5. 2M (including SM) → `bank2`.
6. 1M ← `bank1`.
7. 2C (including LC) → `bank2`.
8. 1C ← `bank1`.
9. 1M, 1C → `bank2`.

This plan ensures that all missionaries and cannibals safely cross the river without violating any constraints.
