Thought about missionaries and cannibals problem for 50 seconds
Meticulous planning

Faced with the scenario of three missionaries, three cannibals, and a boat, I must ensure the boat's balance by ferrying two at a time, carefully avoiding dangerous pairs left alone together.

Taking a closer look

I’m mapping out how to manage the small missionary and large cannibal, ensuring they’re never left alone together. The group also includes three missionaries and three cannibals.

Ensuring safety

I need to ensure that on the boat, if a small missionary is present, the number of cannibals must not surpass the number of missionaries. This requires careful planning of transport.

Ensuring safety

It's crucial to manage the inventory of missionaries and cannibals, keeping the boat balanced and avoiding any dangerous combinations, especially when a small missionary and large cannibal are involved.

Confirming inventory details

I’m piecing together the counts: two normal missionaries, one small missionary, two normal cannibals, and one large cannibal. This ensures a clear and safe starting point for further planning.

Ensuring safe crossings

I’m thinking about verifying that the boat's safety rules prevent dangerous combinations, like a small missionary and large cannibal alone. This requires careful analysis to avoid potential accidents.

Analyzing combinations

I’m considering the constraints of the small missionary and large cannibal, ensuring they never escape together with only the two of them on a bank. This avoids the small missionary being eaten.

Noticing the constraints

I'm considering scenarios where ensuring a normal missionary is present when the boat contains both the small missionary and large cannibal is vital. This prevents the small missionary's safety risk.

Charting the course

I'm mapping out steps to transport everyone safely, ensuring no dangerous pairs are left alone. This involves moving people thoughtfully from bank to bank, balancing risk and safety throughout.

Taking a closer look

I'm thinking through the initial move: sending two cannibals across first, ensuring safety on both banks, and planning the boat's return with at least one person.

Ensuring safety

OK, let's see. By sending two cannibals with the boat, I keep the small missionary safe and ensure all movements stay clear of dangerous pairs.

Mapping the approach

I’m ensuring the boat’s return with one cannibal from bank2, avoiding any dangerous pairings and meeting the safety constraints throughout the transit.

Weighing the options

Now, I'm thinking about sending two missionaries across next. This move keeps the boat and passengers safe, and everything seems to be progressing as needed.

Ensuring safe passage

I'm mapping out which candidate should return with the boat to keep safety intact, adhering to our constraints and rules. It's about maintaining a steady, secure progression.

Evaluating safety and constraints

I’m ensuring the boat's journey and passengers adhere to safety rules and constraints. If the boat returns with a missionary, the composition must stay secure.

Evaluating the options

I’m mapping out if sending two missionaries is safe. The composition stays secure without triggering unsafe combinations. Now, I’m considering who should return with the boat.

Packing the options

I’m digging into the best way to pack the boat with supplies, aiming for safety and avoiding any pairings that might lead to unsafe conditions. Progress is steady.

Evaluating alternatives

Considering returning one cannibal and one missionary to meet the boat's capacity, ensuring a safe return without violating any constraints. This approach keeps progress steady.

Balancing progress

I’m thinking about equalizing missionaries and cannibals on the boat. This ensures safe travel and prevents unsafe pairings, making steady progress.

Mapping transport

I’m considering sending two cannibals to bank2, ensuring safe conditions on both sides. Progressing thoughtfully by checking each group’s safety consistently.

Ensuring safety

Reviewing bank1’s safety, which is good with 1 missionary and 1 cannibal. Now considering transport options, while avoiding unsafe pairings.

Shifting focus

I’m evaluating sending (M1, c2) to bank2. This should meet safety requirements while progressing towards the goal since the boat is already at bank2.

Evaluating transport choices

I’m mapping out safe transport of (M1, c2) to bank2, ensuring no dangerous pairs are left behind as side bank1 remains secure for the return trip.

Weighing options

Considering the safe return of (M1, c2) from bank2 to bank1, I’m focusing on keeping bank1 secure while ensuring a clear path to transport the rest of the group.

Testing optimal pairs

I’m thinking of sending (s, M1) from bank1 to bank2, which is safe since they’re both missionaries. This leaves cannibals on bank1, ensuring continued safety.

Reassessing transport safety

I’m evaluating whether returning one missionary to bank1 maintains safety, ensuring bank2’s security and a secure way forward for the rest of the group.

Evaluating return options

I’ve concluded that only sending a missionary back to bank1 ensures safety, with bank2 remaining secure due to the existing constraints and setup.

Weighing return options

OK, let me see. Bringing back a cannibal to bank1 maintains both bank1 and bank2's safety, even with the constraints in play. This ensures a secure strategy moving forward.

Revisiting options

I’m considering sending a cannibal from bank1 back to bank2 to keep bank1 secure and help ensure all constraints and safety measures are met.

Evaluating return options

I’m mapping out how bringing back one missionary to bank1 ensures both bank1 and bank2's safety, maintaining a secure strategy without risky boat pairings.

Assessing safety

After 12 moves, I’m ensuring both bank1 and bank2 remain secure. Bringing back one missionary to bank1 guarantees everyone stays safe, avoiding risky boat pairings.

Ensuring safety

After 13 moves, I verified that both banks remain safe. Plan involves sequentially sending and returning cannibals and missionaries between banks, maintaining safety at each transition.

Revisiting transitions

OK, let me see. I’m ensuring all transitions between banks are checked for safety and constraints. The plan includes sending and returning missionaries and cannibals sequentially to maintain a secure trajectory.

Adjusting my approach

I’m mapping transitions between banks to ensure safety by sequentially sending and returning cannibals and missionaries, maintaining secure and constraint-compliant states throughout.

Evaluating return options

OK, I’m thinking about how returning missionaries and cannibals might undermine progress. It’s interesting to see that a more effective move might be necessary to overcome this challenge.

Trying a new way

Sending a small missionary and a cannibal to bank2 is a good alternative, ensuring bank1's safety and aligning with constraints.

Balancing choices

I’m weighing the pros and cons of sending a cannibal or a saint back to bank1. The aim is to keep safety for bank1 while making steady progress.

Mapping transitions

Returning "M2 and c1" to bank1 ensures bank1's safety, maintaining the constraint and steady progress.

Assessing safety

Sending a missionary and cannibal to bank2 seems risky since they might leave a saint and a cannibal alone, which is unsafe.

Mapping safe transitions

OK, let me see. I’m analyzing sending one cannibal or missionary back to bank1 to keep bank2 safe. This approach helps maintain a safe balance while moving forward.

Enhancing safety

Returning one cannibal to bank1 ensures bank2's safety with 3 missionaries. This move balances the groups and keeps progressing towards a solution.

Balancing the journey

Returning a missionary to bank1 ensures safety, maintaining a safe ratio between missionaries and cannibals on both banks. Progressing steadily towards a solution.

Finalizing the strategy

Sending the last missionary and large cannibal to bank2 completes the plan. With all safely across, the journey is a success.

Mapping safe transitions

I'm charting out the steps to ferry everyone safely, ensuring each move is safe. Documenting each stage for clarity continues to guide progress.

Below is one acceptable solution. In what follows we imagine that the six persons are “labeled” as follows:

Missionaries: two “normal” missionaries 
𝑀
1
M 
1
​
  and 
𝑀
2
M 
2
​
  and one “small” missionary 
𝑠
s. (Recall that the extra “danger‐rule” applies only when 
𝑠
s is alone with the large cannibal.)
Cannibals: two “normal” cannibals 
𝑐
1
c 
1
​
  and 
𝑐
2
c 
2
​
  and one “large” cannibal 
𝐿
L.
At the start all six people (the three missionaries – 
𝑀
1
M 
1
​
 , 
𝑀
2
M 
2
​
  and 
𝑠
s – and the three cannibals – 
𝑐
1
c 
1
​
 , 
𝑐
2
c 
2
​
  and 
𝐿
L) are on bank1 and the boat (which holds 1 or 2 people) is on bank1. (When a “move” is made the boat must carry at least one person, and on every bank as well as on the boat the “safety conditions” must hold. These are the usual rule that if any missionaries are present then the total number of cannibals there may not exceed the number of missionaries, plus the extra rule that if the only missionary present is the small one 
𝑠
s and she is together with 
𝐿
L (and no other missionary is present) then she is in danger – so that situation is forbidden.)

The plan below lists each crossing in “Move number: direction – who rides”. (After each move we indicate the contents of each bank; we leave aside the “in‐transit” state because we assume that the boat’s load is “safe” provided it does not mix a minority of missionaries with too many cannibals or—importantly—a 
𝑠
+
𝐿
s+L pair by itself.)

All persons have now safely reached bank2. Notice that at no time are the rules violated:

On either bank the number of cannibals never exceeds the number of missionaries (when missionaries are present).
The boat is never empty.
And the extra “danger‐rule” is never triggered (for example, 
𝑠
s is never left alone with 
𝐿
L as the only missionary).
This sequence of 11 moves is one valid plan that meets all the problem’s requirements.
