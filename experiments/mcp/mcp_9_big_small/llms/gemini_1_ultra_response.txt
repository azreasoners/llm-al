Here's a breakdown of the problem, a representation using the types you've defined, and a step-by-step solution.

Problem Breakdown

The Missionaries and Cannibals problem is a classic logic puzzle focused on state-space search. We need to find a series of moves that will transport the group across the river without anyone getting eaten.

Representation

Let's represent the problem state using your defined types:

vessel:
boat (capacity: 2)
locations:
bank1
bank2
groups:
missionaries (count: 3)
cannibals (count: 3)
small_missionaries (count: 1)
big_cannibals (count: 1)
State: We can represent the current state as a tuple:
(number of missionaries on bank1, number of cannibals on bank1, number of small missionaries on bank1, number of big cannibals on bank1, boat location)
Initial State:
(3, 3, 1, 1, bank1)

Goal State:
(0, 0, 0, 0, bank2)

Constraints:

Boat Capacity: The boat can carry at most two people.
Cannibal vs. Missionary: On either bank, cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries.
Small Missionary vs. Big Cannibal: The small missionary cannot be left alone with the big cannibal.
Solution

Here's a possible sequence of moves. Note there might be other valid solutions! Let's use the shorthand 'M' for missionary and 'C' for cannibal, 'SM' for the small missionary, and 'BC' for the big cannibal:

Two cannibals cross to bank2: (1, 1, 1, 1, bank2)
One cannibal returns to bank1: (2, 2, 1, 1, bank1)
Two missionaries cross to bank2: (0, 2, 1, 1, bank2)
One missionary and one cannibal return to bank1: (1, 3, 1, 1, bank1)
Two cannibals cross to bank2: (1, 1, 1, 0, bank2)
One cannibal returns to bank1: (2, 2, 1, 0, bank1)
Two missionaries cross to bank2: (0, 2, 1, 0, bank2)
One cannibal returns to bank1: (1, 3, 1, 0, bank1)
Small missionary and big cannibal cross to bank2: (0, 1, 0, 1, bank2)
One missionary returns to bank1: (1, 1, 0, 1, bank1)
Two cannibals cross to bank2: (1, 0, 0, 0, bank2)
One cannibal returns to bank1: (2, 1, 0, 0, bank1)
The final two missionaries cross to bank2: (0, 0, 0, 0, bank2)

Code Implementation: I can help you write code (Python would be a good choice) to simulate this problem and find solutions.
Variations: We can explore variants of the problem, such as larger groups, boats with different capacities, or additional constraints!
