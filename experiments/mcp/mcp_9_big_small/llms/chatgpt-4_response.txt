To solve this problem of getting all three missionaries and three cannibals from one bank of a river to the other using a boat that carries at most two people, we need to carefully manage the number of missionaries and cannibals on both banks of the river and in the boat at any time. Additionally, the boat cannot travel empty, and we must also consider the special condition involving the large cannibal and the small missionary.

Here's a step-by-step strategy to solve this problem:

Initial Setup:
Bank1: 3 missionaries (M), 3 cannibals (C), including 1 big cannibal (BC) and 1 small missionary (SM)
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Boat's Location: Bank1
Solution Plan:
Move from Bank1 to Bank2: Take 1 missionary and 1 cannibal (including the big cannibal if available).
Bank1: 2M, 2C
Bank2: 1M, 1C
Boat's Location: Bank2
Return to Bank1: Take 1 cannibal back.
Bank1: 2M, 3C
Bank2: 1M
Boat's Location: Bank1
Move from Bank1 to Bank2: Take 2 cannibals (including the big cannibal if not already on Bank2).
Bank1: 2M, 1C
Bank2: 1M, 3C
Boat's Location: Bank2
Return to Bank1: Take 1 cannibal back.
Bank1: 2M, 2C
Bank2: 1M, 2C
Boat's Location: Bank1
Move from Bank1 to Bank2: Take 2 missionaries.
Bank1: 0M, 2C
Bank2: 3M, 2C
Boat's Location: Bank2
Return to Bank1: Take 1 cannibal back.
Bank1: 0M, 3C
Bank2: 3M, 1C
Boat's Location: Bank1
Move from Bank1 to Bank2: Take 2 cannibals.
Bank1: 0M, 1C
Bank2: 3M, 3C
Boat's Location: Bank2
Return to Bank1: Take 1 cannibal back.
Bank1: 0M, 2C
Bank2: 3M, 2C
Boat's Location: Bank1
Move from Bank1 to Bank2: Take 2 cannibals.
Bank1: 0M, 0C
Bank2: 3M, 4C (including the big cannibal)
Boat's Location: Bank2
Conclusion:
This sequence of moves ensures that at no point do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank or in the boat, and it also considers the special condition involving the large cannibal and the small missionary. Thus, all individuals are successfully and safely transferred to Bank2.
