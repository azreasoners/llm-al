Here's a plan to safely transport all the missionaries and cannibals across the river:

1 missionary and 1 cannibal cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
The missionary returns alone to bank1.
2 cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
1 cannibal returns alone to bank1.
2 missionaries (including the small missionary) cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
1 missionary and 1 cannibal return to bank1 in the boat.
2 missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
1 missionary returns alone to bank1.
The remaining 2 cannibals (including the large cannibal) cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
1 cannibal returns alone to bank1.
The remaining missionary and cannibal cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.

At the end of this process, all 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals will be on bank2, with the boat also on bank2. The constraints are satisfied throughout:

The boat never crosses with more than 2 people.
Whenever missionaries and cannibals are together, the cannibals never outnumber the missionaries.
The small missionary is never left alone with the large cannibal.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
