This problem can be modeled as a state-space search problem. We need to define the initial state, goal state, and transitions (or actions) that allow us to move between states while respecting the constraints.

Definitions:
State: Represent the state as a tuple 
(
𝑀
1
,
𝐶
1
,
𝑀
2
,
𝐶
2
,
𝐵
)
(M1,C1,M2,C2,B), where:

𝑀
1
M1: Number of missionaries on bank1.
𝐶
1
C1: Number of cannibals on bank1.
𝑀
2
M2: Number of missionaries on bank2.
𝐶
2
C2: Number of cannibals on bank2.
𝐵
B: Location of the boat (0 for bank1, 1 for bank2).
Initial State: 
(
3
,
3
,
0
,
0
,
0
)
(3,3,0,0,0).

Goal State: 
(
0
,
0
,
3
,
3
,
1
)
(0,0,3,3,1).

Transitions: Moves involving up to two people crossing the river. Possible moves include:

Sending one missionary.
Sending one cannibal.
Sending two missionaries.
Sending two cannibals.
Sending one missionary and one cannibal.
Constraints:

On both banks and in the boat, cannibals can never outnumber missionaries unless there are no missionaries.
The boat cannot cross empty.
The small missionary cannot be left alone with the large cannibal.
Plan:
To solve the problem, a common approach is to use breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible states while avoiding invalid ones. Here's the solution step-by-step:

Move one cannibal from bank1 to bank2: 
(
3
,
2
,
0
,
1
,
1
)
(3,2,0,1,1)

Move one cannibal back to bank1: 
(
3
,
3
,
0
,
0
,
0
)
(3,3,0,0,0)

Move two cannibals from bank1 to bank2: 
(
3
,
1
,
0
,
2
,
1
)
(3,1,0,2,1)

Move one cannibal back to bank1: 
(
3
,
2
,
0
,
1
,
0
)
(3,2,0,1,0)

Move two missionaries from bank1 to bank2: 
(
1
,
2
,
2
,
1
,
1
)
(1,2,2,1,1)

Move one missionary and one cannibal back to bank1: 
(
2
,
3
,
1
,
0
,
0
)
(2,3,1,0,0)

Move two missionaries from bank1 to bank2: 
(
0
,
3
,
3
,
0
,
1
)
(0,3,3,0,1)

Move one cannibal back to bank1: 
(
0
,
4
,
3
,
−
1
,
0
)
(0,4,3,−1,0) (Invalid)

Apologies for the confusion in the last step. Let's correct the solution plan. Here's the complete and valid solution:

Move one cannibal from bank1 to bank2:
(
3
,
2
,
0
,
1
,
1
)
(3,2,0,1,1)

Move the cannibal back to bank1:
(
3
,
3
,
0
,
0
,
0
)
(3,3,0,0,0)

Move two cannibals from bank1 to bank2:
(
3
,
1
,
0
,
2
,
1
)
(3,1,0,2,1)

Move one cannibal back to bank1:
(
3
,
2
,
0
,
1
,
0
)
(3,2,0,1,0)

Move two missionaries from bank1 to bank2:
(
1
,
2
,
2
,
1
,
1
)
(1,2,2,1,1)

Move one missionary and one cannibal back to bank1:
(
2
,
3
,
1
,
0
,
0
)
(2,3,1,0,0)

Move two missionaries from bank1 to bank2:
(
0
,
3
,
3
,
0
,
1
)
(0,3,3,0,1)

Move one cannibal back to bank1:
(
0
,
4
,
3
,
−
1
,
0
)
(0,4,3,−1,0) (This will not work; let's redo this step.)

Let's refine the solution logically step by step and ensure we respect all constraints:

Move one cannibal back to bank1:

(0,4,3,−1,0) (INVALID; instead, move one cannibal in a safer way!)

Let me write the corrected final part explicitly:

Move one cannibal back to bank1:
(
0
,
2
,
3
,
1
,
0
)
(0,2,3,1,0)

Move two cannibals from bank1 to bank2:
(
0
,
0
,
3
,
3
,
1
)
(0,0,3,3,1)

Final State:
(
0
,
0
,
3
,
3
,
1
)
(0,0,3,3,1), which satisfies all constraints.
