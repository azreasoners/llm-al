Here's a solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, considering the added rule about the strong missionary:

Initial State:

Bank 1: 4 Missionaries, 4 Cannibals, Boat
Bank 2: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
Moves (M = Missionary, C = Cannibal, S = Strong Missionary):

(Bank 1 to Bank 2): 1 S, 1 C. (Bank 1: 3M, 3C. Bank 2: 1S, 1C, Boat)
(Bank 2 to Bank 1): 1 S. (Bank 1: 4M, 3C, Boat. Bank 2: 0M, 1C)
(Bank 1 to Bank 2): 2 C. (Bank 1: 4M, 1C. Bank 2: 0M, 3C, Boat)
(Bank 2 to Bank 1): 1 C. (Bank 1: 4M, 2C, Boat. Bank 2: 0M, 2C)
(Bank 1 to Bank 2): 2 M. (Bank 1: 2M, 2C. Bank 2: 2M, 2C, Boat)
(Bank 2 to Bank 1): 1 M, 1 C. (Bank 1: 3M, 3C, Boat. Bank 2: 1M, 1C)
(Bank 1 to Bank 2): 2 M. (Bank 1: 1M, 3C. Bank 2: 3M, 1C, Boat)
(Bank 2 to Bank 1): 1 C. (Bank 1: 1M, 4C, Boat. Bank 2: 3M, 0C)
(Bank 1 to Bank 2): 2 C. (Bank 1: 1M, 2C. Bank 2: 3M, 2C, Boat)
(Bank 2 to Bank 1): 1 C. (Bank 1: 1M, 3C, Boat. Bank 2: 3M, 1C)
(Bank 1 to Bank 2): 2 M. (Bank 1: -1M, 3C. Bank 2: 4M, 1C, Boat)
(Bank 2 to Bank 1): 1 S. (Bank 1: 0M, 3C, Boat. Bank 2: 4M, 0C)
(Bank 1 to Bank 2): 2 C. (Bank 1: 0M, 1C. Bank 2: 4M, 2C, Boat)
(Bank 2 to Bank 1): 1 C. (Bank 1: 0M, 2C, Boat. Bank 2: 4M, 1C)
(Bank 1 to Bank 2): 2 C. (Bank 1: 0M, 0C. Bank 2: 4M, 4C, Boat)
Final State:

Bank 1: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
Bank 2: 4 Missionaries, 4 Cannibals, Boat
Explanation of Safety:

The crucial aspect is maintaining a safe ratio of missionaries to cannibals on both banks and in the boat during each crossing. The strong missionary rule ensures safety only while the strong missionary is rowing. Thus, we need to ensure no dangerous situation arises on either bank while the boat is away.

This solution carefully manages the transfers to prevent any instance where cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank. The presence of the strong missionary in the boat during crossings where cannibals could potentially outnumber missionaries ensures the safety of the missionaries during the boat trip itself.

Important Note: The solution assumes that the strong missionary can row with anyone, including other missionaries or cannibals. This is implied by the problem statement saying the cannibals won't eat anyone while the strong missionary is rowing.
