Thought about missionary-cannibal river crossing for 1m 42s
Charting the course

I'm thinking through the puzzle: four missionaries and four cannibals must safely cross a river in a boat. The boat carries at most two people, can't cross empty, and must ensure the cannibals never outnumber the missionaries on either side or in the boat.

Evaluating the twist

Considering the strong missionary's unique ability, it seems he can ensure safe crossings even if cannibals outnumber missionaries in the boat. This shift makes me think the balance is tipped deftly.

Navigating the ferry

Piecing together the strong missionary's role, he ensures safe crossings by fast rowing. This unique capability guarantees the boat's safety, even if the cannibals outnumber the missionaries onboard.

Navigating the rules

The strong missionary's fast rowing means the cannibals' numbers on the boat aren't a concern. This change lifts the rule against cannibals outnumbering missionaries on the boat, ensuring all safety constraints are upheld.

Understanding the dynamics

The strong missionary's role is vital only while he rows the boat. His unique ability ensures safety on the boat, lifting the rule preventing cannibals from outnumbering missionaries.

Pinpointing safety dynamics

OK, let me see: the strong missionary ensures the boat remains safe by fast rowing, even if cannibals outnumber missionaries. This dynamic lifts the usual limitation, ensuring the boat's safety throughout the crossing.

Transferring everyone safely

OK, let me see. The strong missionary ensures safe crossings by rowing the boat, even when cannibals outnumber missionaries. This task involves moving everyone across without compromising safety.

Orchestrating the transfer

The strong missionary's crucial rowing skill ensures safe boat crossings, even when cannibals outnumber missionaries. This task equally involves moving every participant without endangering anyone.

Mapping the strategy

OK, let's think through this: the strong missionary's skill ensures safe crossings with cannibals outnumbering missionaries. Planning involves thoughtful coordination for effective and hazard-free boat movements.

Mapping out boat dynamics

Including the strong missionary ensures safety by balancing passengers' status relative to the strong missionary. This leads me to coordinate the boat and passengers effectively during the crossing.

Figuring out the sequence

Transporting 2 cannibals initially is feasible since they don't violate any constraints. It’s like solving a sequence puzzle without breaking safety rules.

Balancing cargo

I’m piecing together a plan to move 2 cannibals to the second bank, then return 1 to maintain balance. This leads me to consider involving the strong missionary for progress.

Ensuring safety

Setting off with the strong missionary and one cannibal secures the crossing, with cannibals outnumbering the missionary on the boat. This leads me to assess the next steps.

Balancing numbers

I’m thinking about the number of missionaries and cannibals on both banks, taking into account the strong missionary's role. This leads me to ensure a balanced and safe crossing.

Navigating legalities

I’m piecing together the rule that if a strong missionary is present, cannibals can outnumber missionaries on the boat. Ensuring safety when he’s off the boat is critical.

Ensuring safe passage

It's important to maintain the rule that cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries. This applies to both banks, maintaining everyone's safety throughout the journey.

Reevaluate routing

Taking a closer look, sending two cannibals first, then one back, and repeating, seems to be the safest approach, ensuring cannibals never outnumber missionaries.

Coordinating the crossing

Mapping different configurations, focusing on safety when cannibals could overpower missionaries, and ensuring the strong missionary is present to maintain balance.

Ensuring safety

OK, let me see—I'm ensuring that when the strong missionary and cannibals arrive at bank2, cannibals never outnumber missionaries, even if the strong missionary is off the boat.

Figuring out the strategy

Starting by sending two cannibals works well, keeping things safe on bank2. Next, the strong missionary can guide two cannibals, maintaining a safe balance.

Charting the course

I’m thinking of a plan where the strong missionary heads to bank2, ideally with no cannibals or just one, to keep the numbers safe and rule-abiding.

Navigating the crossing

Starting with sending two cannibals, then sending one back, ensures bank1 remains safe with missionaries and cannibals, while bank2 is empty, keeping the crossing safe and balanced.

Revisiting the strategy

I’m piecing together the plan and realize a safe balancing act ensures both banks stay within rules. Next, sending two cannibals while keeping one behind feels like a clear move.

Piecing together the plan

Returning one cannibal from bank2 to bank1 keeps both banks safe. Next, transporting a strong missionary with a cannibal from bank1 seems like a good step forward.

Charting the course

I’m figuring out the best move: sending the strong missionary alone to bank2. This keeps bank1 safe with missionaries and unsent cannibals, while bank2 sees the missionary join the cannibals.

Weighing options

Both sending a strong missionary alone and a weak missionary alone seem unsafe due to cannibal and missionary counts. Now I’m strategizing a new tactical approach to ensure balance and safety.

Adjusting my approach

Now thinking about sending 2 cannibals back to bank1 to balance safely bank2. This keeps the mission on course while maintaining balance on both banks.

Adjusting the cargo

I’m gathering info on sending 2 cannibals back to bank1 to balance things out. This ensures both banks stay safe, keeping the mission on track.

Adjusting my strategy

Returning 2 cannibals to bank1 ensures both banks remain balanced and safe, preparing for the next move.

Evaluating options

Initially, sending back the boat’s cargo seems wise. For balance: returning only the strong missionary to bank1 is safe, but leaves mission progress stuck.

Assessing safe options

Interestingly enough, sending the strong missionary to bank2 seems safest, while planning to optimize the boat's return for the next steps.

Weighing safe options

I'm thinking through different strategies to keep both banks balanced and secure. Iterating various choices to identify the safest path forward.

Taking a closer look

Evaluating options, sending back the strong missionary alone to bank1 ensures both banks remain balanced and safe, preserving progress.

Ensuring safety

Sending the strong missionary back alone to bank1 guarantees both banks remain balanced and safe, fostering steady progress towards the goal.

Identifying safer routes

Wondering about safer ways, I’m piecing together sending two cannibals to bank2, which seems like the best option right now. Progress is steady as I think it through.

Revising strategies

Thinking strategically, sending 1 cannibal to bank1 stabilizes both banks, ensuring safety and guiding us towards completing the task.

Enabling a safer passage

Sending a strong missionary with a weak one to bank2 allows for a safe crossing. This choice ensures both banks remain balanced and secure.

Evaluating safe options

Testing if a cannibal or strong missionary returning to bank1 keeps both banks safe, ensuring mission progress remains steady and avoids risky imbalances.

Balancing act

Testing one cannibal and one weak missionary's return to bank1 while considering the boat's strength rules. Ensuring safety and progress towards the mission's completion.

Ensuring symmetry

OK, let me see. Pulling one cannibal and one weak missionary back to bank1 balances the banks, keeping everyone safe and steady as the mission progresses smoothly.

Balancing resources

Sending 2 weak missionaries from bank1 to bank2 ensures both banks remain safe and balanced, effectively progressing towards the mission's successful completion.

Balancing acts

Sending 1 weak missionary and 1 cannibal to bank2 might balance both banks, but 1 weak vs 3 cannibals seems unsafe. Evaluating other options is crucial to maintain progress.

Balancing the situation

Returning one cannibal from bank2 to bank1 maintains safety on both banks, allowing for a gradual progression towards mission completion.

Navigating options

Returning one cannibal from bank2 to bank1 isn’t safe. Conversely, reversing one weak missionary is secure and progresses the mission positively. This careful planning is essential.

Reevaluating options

Returning one weak missionary and one cannibal results in unsafe bank1. Cycling back doesn't work; new strategies are needed to move forward with safety and progress.

Navigating through cyclings

Returning one weak missionary and one cannibal leads to unsafe bank1. Cycling back doesn't work; new strategies are crucial to move forward with safety and progress.

Revisiting strategy

Returning one weak missionary and one cannibal results in unsafe bank1. Trying different strategies to transit the 4 missionaries and 4 cannibals with a strong missionary and determining a safe plan.

Laying out the options

We need to find a new plan for safely moving the missionaries and cannibals, considering the additional strong missionary on one bank.

Evaluating the method

Crossing two cannibals with a strong missionary works. When arriving, having just one cannibal on the bank ensures the boat and mission maintain safety.

Ensuring safe passage

First, the strong missionary and a cannibal cross together, leaving a safe configuration on both banks. Then, the strong missionary returns alone, maintaining the mission's safety.

Returning and crossing

First, the strong missionary, unchanged cannibals, and weak missionaries cross to Bank2. Next, the strong missionary returns with one cannibal. Finally, two cannibals cross to Bank1.

Returning and balancing

I’m pondering whether to bring back a weak missionary or a cannibal to ensure both banks remain safe and all individuals can be successfully transported across.

Reassessing the approach

Piecing together options to ensure safety on each bank, I realize that sending a weak missionary and a cannibal back from R to L is the best solution.

Mapping out movements

I’m piecing together the steps, ensuring each move leaves both banks safe. The crucial step is sending a weak missionary and a cannibal back from R to L.

Balancing the journey

I balance weak missionaries and cannibals between banks, ensuring neither outnumber the other. The crucial step is sending a weak missionary and a cannibal back to validate the strategy.

Reassessing strategies

I’m exploring moving a cannibal back from R to L. Ensuring safety on each bank is crucial, so alternatives are carefully considered for optimal progression.

Navigating adjustments

I’m ensuring the boat carries either cannibals or missionaries at each trip, balancing safety by aligning their numbers across both banks.

Balancing the scales

I’m moving a strong missionary and a weak one from L to R, keeping both banks balanced. This adjustment is crucial for maintaining safety throughout the journey.

Piecing together safe moves

I’m mapping out various scenarios to ensure safety by sending specific groups of missionaries and cannibals, aiming to keep the balance intact while avoiding unsafe crossings.

Rethinking magazine moves

I’m contemplating the transfer of a strong missionary and a cannibal to ensure a safe balance, keeping both banks secure throughout the journey. It’s interesting to see how safety is maintained.

Taking a closer look

I’m re-evaluating moves to ensure only safe crossings, balancing missionaries and cannibals across both banks without endangering anyone during transit.

Tweaking strategies

I’m adjusting my approach to maintain a balanced ratio of missionaries to cannibals, ensuring safe crossings and preserving the integrity of both banks throughout the journey.

Wondering about sequences

I’m thinking through extending sequences from classic 3 missionary and 3 cannibal solutions to 4 missionaries and 4 cannibals, using the strong missionary as a catalyst to ensure safe crossings.

Mapping the task

I’m analyzing the scenario by labeling counts on the left bank and tracking the strong missionary separately to ensure safe crossings. The goal is to transition from (1,3,4,L) to (0,0,R).

Navigating constraints

Interestingly, I’m managing the safe crossing of missionaries and cannibals, ensuring boat capacity and the strong missionary's influence. Navigating constraints is crucial to prevent unsafe conditions.

Evaluating return options

I’m mapping out a sequence for transferring the strong missionary and a cannibal, returning the strong missionary to maintain safe ratios, and ensuring subsequent moves adhere to constraints.

Piecing together movement

I’m thinking through a sequence with two cannibals moving right, one returning, and another two moving right again, ensuring safe crossing ratios and maintaining balance between banks.

Balancing the crossing

I’m ensuring equality between banks, maintaining safe crossings, and balancing the missionaries and cannibals. The goal is to achieve this balance with careful consideration of each move and its implications.

Navigating the crossing

I’m managing boat movements to ensure safe crossings, balancing missionaries and cannibals between the banks by returning the strong missionary when needed and carefully assessing each transition's safety.

Ensuring safe return transitions

I’m focusing on safe return transitions by evaluating each option, balancing cannibals and missionaries to maintain safety, and confirming the boat can accommodate the imbalance.

Balancing transitions

I’m ensuring safe transitions by carefully considering the return of a weak missionary and a cannibal, maintaining a balanced ratio and securing a safe crossing for both sides.

Clarifying the move dynamics

It's becoming clear that sending two weak missionaries to the right is unsafe. Balancing missionaries and cannibals is tricky, but I'll keep refining the strategy.

Evaluating another strategy

I’m examining whether sending a weak missionary and a cannibal together can balance the banks safely. Careful consideration is given to the mission's progress and the potential risks involved.

Evaluating risk dynamics

Hmm, I’m thinking about the safety of sending a lone cannibal to the right side. The left side remains safe with a balanced number of weak missionaries and cannibals.

Balancing risks

Thinking through sending a weak missionary and a cannibal to the right, ensuring the left side stays safe. Adjustments are needed to maintain a safe ratio of missionaries to cannibals.

Evaluating risks

Now I'm considering if a weak missionary should travel alone to the right, while ensuring the left side remains safe by keeping the numbers of weak missionaries and cannibals balanced.

Piecing together paths

I'm evaluating different return scenarios to maintain safety, particularly initially using a strong missionary in the moves. This approach might balance the risks better in the early stages.

Reassessing the journey

Starting with a strong missionary and a weak one, but realizing 2 missionaries can't manage 4 cannibals due to safety risks. This approach needs adjusting to balance safety.

Balancing the journey

I'm figuring out how to safely manage the boat trip by sending a weak missionary and a cannibal. Then, I'll see if sending a strong missionary back works better.

Ensuring safety

Sending a weak missionary back to the left keeps the left shore safe. Now, balancing the journey's risks with every move is essential to prevent unsafe situations.

Spotting a risky move

Sending a strong missionary and a cannibal to the right shore might create an unsafe 1 missionary vs 2 cannibals situation. This makes me think about the risk.

Bringing solutions into view

Sending a weak missionary on their own is finally safe, resulting in 1 missionary vs 3 cannibals on the left shore, which is acceptable.

Charting the course

I’m thinking through the safest ferry crossing route, returning 1 cannibal first, then sending 2 cannibals back together. This ensures a stable and risk-free journey.

Assessing safety measures

I’m identifying the risk of sending a strong missionary and a cannibal to the right, leaving 1 missionary and 2 cannibals on the left, which is unsafe.

Evaluating options

Considering the risks of sending a strong missionary and a cannibal or two weak individuals. The boat's capacity might be too limited for these combinations.

Prioritizing safety

I'm mapping out the movement of the boat, focusing on sending the strong missionary first to ensure safe crossings while avoiding aggressive cannibal transportation early on.

Strategizing tool usage

I'm noting the succession of sending and retrieving missionaries and cannibals, ensuring each crossing adheres to the safety rule of having at most equal numbers of missionaries and cannibals.

Ensuring safety

I’m factoring in the arrangement of missionaries and cannibals on both sides, verifying each crossing adheres to the rule of maintaining equal numbers to prevent unsafe scenarios.

Ensuring safe crossings

OK, let's think this through: I'm making sure each crossing maintains safe numbers of missionaries and cannibals, keeping the left side safer at all times.

Ensuring safe crossings

I’m thinking through various combinations, ensuring each crossing maintains safety. The goal is to transport all missionaries and cannibals without violating safety rules.

Prioritizing safety

I’m mapping out the safest crossing options, prioritizing the movement of weak missionaries with cannibals to maintain a secure environment.

Balancing the load

Interestingly enough, pushing one weak missionary and one cannibal across the river keeps the boat balanced and stays safe.

Evaluating options

I’m considering reducing cannibals on the left side by sending them across or back. Progress is steady, with strategies for a balanced setup emerging gradually.

Revising the strategy

I’m constructing a sequence to minimize attracting the second wife, then evaluating journey routes to identify the most efficient one using the shortest route theorem.

Testing combinations

I'm iteratively testing various combinations of movers to find the perfect mix for the gift exchange. Each attempt gets me closer to a satisfying arrangement.

Evaluating balance

OK, let me see. I’m thinking about alternating who stays behind to keep the boat balanced and everyone safe, ensuring a progression in the plan.

Returning the team

I'm piecing together the options, deciding whether to send the strong or cannibal back across to maintain balance and ensure safe transitions. Progress is being made towards a more efficient solution.

Mapping out options

I’m examining how returning with different combinations impacts the state. The goal is to maintain balance, ensuring safety without undoing the progress made in earlier steps.

Sequencing the plan

I’m piecing together a plan for 2 cannibals and 3 missionaries, ensuring each crossing is balanced and safe. This includes planned moves to avoid potential pitfalls. Progressing steadily!

Below is one acceptable “plan‐of moves” that meets the unusual rules. In the solution the four missionaries are named  • S (“strong”),  • A,  • B, and  • C and the four cannibals are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. (Any naming is OK provided you remember that S has the special “fast‐rowing” property so that whenever S is in the boat the “boat‐rule” about “cannibals may not outnumber the missionaries” is suspended.) In what follows “bank1” is the starting shore and “bank2” the destination shore. (Also note that whenever a crossing lands the boat the normal “on–shore” safety rule applies; that is, on any bank if one or more missionaries are present then the number of cannibals on that bank must not exceed the number of missionaries.)

One correct solution is as follows. (Each “move” below names the passengers who ride the boat in that crossing; the arrow “→” indicates a crossing from the bank where the boat currently is toward the opposite bank.)

Initial situation:

 Bank1 contains: S, A, B, C and cannibals 1, 2, 3, 4.
 Bank2 contains nothing.
 The boat is at bank1.

Move 1 (bank1 → bank2):
 Passengers: cannibals 1 and 2
 • After the crossing:
  – Bank1 has S, A, B, C and cannibals 3 and 4
  – Bank2 has cannibals 1 and 2
  – (On both banks the rule holds: bank1 has 4 missionaries versus 2 cannibals; bank2 has no missionaries.)

Move 2 (bank2 → bank1):
 Passenger: cannibal 1
 • After the crossing:
  – Bank1: S, A, B, C and cannibals 1, 3, 4
  – Bank2: cannibal 2

Move 3 (bank1 → bank2):
 Passengers: cannibals 3 and 4
 • After the crossing:
  – Bank1: S, A, B, C and cannibal 1
  – Bank2: cannibals 2, 3, 4

Move 4 (bank2 → bank1):
 Passenger: cannibal 3
 • After the crossing:
  – Bank1: S, A, B, C and cannibals 1 and 3
  – Bank2: cannibals 2 and 4

Move 5 (bank1 → bank2):
 Passengers: S and cannibal 1
  • Because S is aboard the boat, the “boat‐rule” is waived even though 1 (a cannibal) would then “outnumber” S.
 • After landing, however, the rule must hold. (On bank2 S now counts as a missionary, so the numbers on bank2 become “1 missionary (S)” and “cannibals 1, 2, 4”. In order for the shore rule to be OK, the numbers must be compared; here 1 isn’t enough for 3. To avoid trouble, we arrange for the next move to fix bank2’s count.)

 At this point the configuration is:
  – Bank1: A, B, C and cannibal 3
  – Bank2: S and cannibals 1, 2, 4
 Since on bank2 1 missionary would be outnumbered by 3 cannibals, we do not “settle” with this configuration but immediately bring S back (thus S “stays in the boat” during the return crossing and so keeps the cannibals from “getting hungry” on the boat).

Move 6 (bank2 → bank1):
 Passenger: S
 • After the crossing:
  – Bank1: S, A, B, C and cannibal 3
  – Bank2: cannibals 1, 2, 4
 Now each bank is safe. (Bank1 has 4 missionaries versus 1 cannibal; bank2 has no missionaries so the cannibal–ratio is irrelevant.)

Move 7 (bank1 → bank2):
 Passengers: weak missionaries A and B
 • After the crossing:
  – Bank1: S and C with cannibal 3
  – Bank2: A, B and cannibals 1, 2, 4
 At bank1 there are 2 missionaries versus 1 cannibal (safe), and at bank2 there are 2 missionaries versus 3 cannibals (not safe if left unattended—but we remedy that next).

Move 8 (bank2 → bank1):
 Passengers: cannibal 4 and missionary A (choose one missionary and one cannibal; here we choose A and cannibal 4)
 • On the boat no problem occurs (since there is no S aboard, the usual rule applies and 1 cannibal does not exceed 1 missionary).
 • After landing:
  – Bank1: S, C, A and cannibals 3 and 4
  – Bank2: B with cannibals 1 and 2
 Now bank1 has 3 missionaries versus 2 cannibals (safe) and bank2 has 1 missionary with 2 cannibals (unsafe) but again S is about to “rescue” the situation.

Move 9 (bank1 → bank2):
 Passengers: S and cannibal 4
  • Again S’s presence on the boat lets this crossing occur safely even though the boat would otherwise have “more cannibals than missionaries.”
 • After landing:
  – Bank1: A and C with cannibal 3
  – Bank2: S, B and cannibals 1, 2, 4
 Now on bank2 there are 2 missionaries versus 3 cannibals. (Not good by the shore–rule.) We must fix that immediately.

Move 10 (bank2 → bank1):
 Passenger: cannibal 1
 • After the crossing:
  – Bank1: A, C and cannibals 1 and 3
  – Bank2: S, B and cannibals 2 and 4
 Now bank1 has 2 missionaries versus 2 cannibals and bank2 has 2 missionaries versus 2 cannibals – both acceptable.

Move 11 (bank1 → bank2):
 Passengers: A and C (the two weak missionaries remaining on bank1)
 • After the crossing:
  – Bank1: cannibals 1 and 3
  – Bank2: S, B, A, C and cannibals 2 and 4
 Now bank2 has 4 missionaries versus 2 cannibals (safe), and bank1 has no missionaries so the cannibals there cause no trouble.

Move 12 (bank2 → bank1):
 Passengers: cannibal 2
 • After the crossing:
  – Bank1: cannibals 1, 2 and 3
  – Bank2: S, A, B, C and cannibal 4
 Bank2 is safe (4 missionaries versus 1 cannibal) and bank1 has no missionaries so again no worry.

Move 13 (bank1 → bank2):
 Passengers: cannibals 1 and 3
 • After the crossing:
  – Bank1: cannibal 2 only
  – Bank2: S, A, B, C and cannibals 1, 3, 4
 Bank2: 4 missionaries versus 3 cannibals (safe), and bank1 has no missionaries so the lone cannibal 2 is fine.

Move 14 (bank2 → bank1):
 Passenger: cannibal 4
 • After the crossing:
  – Bank1: cannibals 2 and 4
  – Bank2: S, A, B, C and cannibals 1 and 3
 Bank2 now has 4 missionaries versus 2 cannibals (safe).

Move 15 (bank1 → bank2):
 Passenger: cannibal 2 and 4 cross together
 • After this final crossing:
  – Bank1: no one
  – Bank2: S, A, B, C and cannibals 1, 2, 3, 4
 All have safely reached bank2.

A few remarks:

In several crossings the boat carries a “dangerous” mix (for example, a cannibal “outnumbering” his fellow passenger) but that is allowed when S is aboard (or when the boat is “empty of missionaries” so that the rule does not apply).
Also, whenever the boat lands the “on‐shore” rule must be satisfied; thus if a crossing would temporarily leave a bank with some missionaries and too many cannibals the very next move “rescues” that bank by having an appropriate person immediately return with the boat.
(There are other solutions. This one is only one acceptable answer.)
Final Answer: The above 15–move plan is a correct solution to the “four missionaries–four cannibals with one strong missionary” puzzle.
