Here's how you can solve the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem with the added element of a strong missionary to protect them on the boat.

Understanding the Rules:

Capacity: Boat can carry a maximum of two people.
Safety on Banks: Cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries on either bank.
Safety on Boat: Cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries on the boat, unless the strong missionary is present.
Strong Missionary: The strong missionary's presence on the boat prevents the cannibals from attacking.
Representing the Problem:

Let's use these representations:

M: Missionaries
C: Cannibals
S: Strong missionary
B: Boat
State Representation:

A state can be represented as: (# of Missionaries on bank1, # of Cannibals on bank1, Boat Location)

Initial State: (4, 4, bank1)
Goal State: (0, 0, bank2)
Possible Actions:

Here are the possible moves, assuming the strong missionary can row the boat alone:

One missionary and one cannibal cross to bank2 (MC ->)
One missionary crosses to bank2 (M ->)
Two missionaries cross to bank2 (MM ->)
The strong missionary and one cannibal cross to bank2 (SC ->)
One cannibal crosses to bank2 (C ->)
One cannibal returns to bank1 (<- C)
Two cannibals return to bank1 (<- CC)
One missionary returns to bank1 (<- M)
Solution (One Possible Plan):

SC -> (3, 3, bank2)
<- C (3, 4, bank1)
MM -> (1, 4, bank2)
<- M (2, 4, bank1)
MC -> (1, 3, bank2)
<- C (2, 3, bank1)
MC -> (1, 2, bank2)
<- M (2, 2, bank1)
SC -> (1, 1, bank2)
<- S (2, 1, bank1)
SC -> (1, 0, bank2)
<- C (2, 0, bank1)
CC -> (0, 0, bank2)
Important Notes:

There are other valid solutions to this problem.
The strong missionary makes certain moves possible that wouldn't be safe normally.
Let me know if you'd like help visualizing these steps, or would like to see a different solution path!
