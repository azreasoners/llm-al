Here is a plan to get all four missionaries and four cannibals safely across the river from bank1 to bank2:

The strong missionary takes 1 cannibal across to bank2. (3M, 3C at bank1; 1M, 1C at bank2)
The strong missionary returns alone to bank1. (4M, 3C at bank1; 0M, 1C at bank2)
The strong missionary takes 2 cannibals across to bank2. (4M, 1C at bank1; 0M, 3C at bank2)
The strong missionary returns with 1 cannibal to bank1. (4M, 2C at bank1; 0M, 2C at bank2)
The strong missionary takes 2 cannibals across to bank2. (4M, 0C at bank1; 0M, 4C at bank2)
The strong missionary returns alone to bank1. (4M, 0C at bank1; 0M, 4C at bank2)
The strong missionary takes 2 missionaries across to bank2. (2M, 0C at bank1; 2M, 4C at bank2)
1 missionary and 1 cannibal return to bank1. (3M, 1C at bank1; 1M, 3C at bank2)
2 missionaries cross to bank2. (1M, 1C at bank1; 3M, 3C at bank2)
The strong missionary returns alone to bank1. (2M, 1C at bank1; 2M, 3C at bank2)
The strong missionary takes the remaining 1 missionary and 1 cannibal across to bank2. (0M, 0C at bank1; 4M, 4C at bank2)
At the end, all 4 missionaries and 4 cannibals are safely at bank2, with the cannibals never outnumbering the missionaries at any point. The strong missionary rowing solo ensures the missionaries' safety on the boat crossings with a cannibal.
