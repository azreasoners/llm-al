To solve the problem of transferring four missionaries and four cannibals across a river using a boat that can carry a maximum of two people, while ensuring that the cannibals never outnumber the missionaries on either bank or in the boat, we can use a step-by-step strategy. We need to utilize the fact that as long as the strong missionary rows the boat, the cannibals won't eat the missionaries. Here's one way to approach the problem:

Start Configuration:
Bank 1: 4 missionaries (M), 4 cannibals (C), 1 boat
Bank 2: 0 M, 0 C
Step 1: The strong missionary (M) and one cannibal (C) row to Bank 2.
Bank 1: 3 M, 3 C
Bank 2: 1 M, 1 C, boat
Step 2: The strong missionary returns alone to Bank 1.
Bank 1: 4 M, 3 C, boat
Bank 2: 0 M, 1 C
Step 3: Two cannibals row to Bank 2.
Bank 1: 4 M, 1 C
Bank 2: 0 M, 3 C, boat
Step 4: One cannibal returns to Bank 1 with the boat.
Bank 1: 4 M, 2 C, boat
Bank 2: 0 M, 2 C
Step 5: The strong missionary and one cannibal row to Bank 2 again.
Bank 1: 3 M, 1 C
Bank 2: 1 M, 3 C, boat
Step 6: The strong missionary returns to Bank 1.
Bank 1: 4 M, 1 C, boat
Bank 2: 0 M, 3 C
Step 7: Two cannibals row to Bank 2.
Bank 1: 4 M, 0 C
Bank 2: 0 M, 4 C, boat
Step 8: One cannibal returns to Bank 1 with the boat.
Bank 1: 4 M, 1 C, boat
Bank 2: 0 M, 3 C
Step 9: The strong missionary and one cannibal row to Bank 2.
Bank 1: 3 M, 0 C
Bank 2: 1 M, 4 C, boat
Step 10: The strong missionary returns to Bank 1.
Bank 1: 4 M, 0 C, boat
Bank 2: 0 M, 4 C
Step 11: Two missionaries row to Bank 2.
Bank 1: 2 M, 0 C
Bank 2: 2 M, 4 C, boat
Step 12: The strong missionary returns to Bank 1.
Bank 1: 3 M, 0 C, boat
Bank 2: 1 M, 4 C
Step 13: Two missionaries row to Bank 2.
Bank 1: 1 M, 0 C
Bank 2: 3 M, 4 C, boat
Step 14: The strong missionary returns to Bank 1.
Bank 1: 2 M, 0 C, boat
Bank 2: 2 M, 4 C
Step 15: The last two missionaries row to Bank 2.
Bank 1: 0 M, 0 C
Bank 2: 4 M, 4 C, boat
This solution ensures that at no point do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank, and that the strong missionary who can deter the cannibals is utilized effectively. Each step adheres to the rules provided and safely transports all individuals across the river.
