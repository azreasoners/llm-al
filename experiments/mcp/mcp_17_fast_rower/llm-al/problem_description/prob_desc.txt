Four missionaries and four cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. However, there is one strong missionary which can row fast. As long as the strong missionary rows, then the cannibals won't become so hungry that they will eat the missionaries.
