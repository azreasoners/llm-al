Use the code interpreter to generate a Python program to solve the following problem. Revise the program as many times as needed until the program is correct.

There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Four missionaries and four cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. However, there is one strong missionary which can row fast. As long as the strong missionary rows, then the cannibals won't become so hungry that they will eat the missionaries.

boat is a vessel. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Four missionaries and four cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.
