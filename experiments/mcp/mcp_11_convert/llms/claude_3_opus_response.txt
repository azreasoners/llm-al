To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of actions that will transport all missionaries and cannibals from bank1 to bank2 while adhering to the given constraints. Here's a step-by-step plan:

Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
(bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal; bank2: 2 cannibals; boat at bank2)
One cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1 in the boat.
(bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals; bank2: 1 cannibal; boat at bank1)
Two missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
(bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals; bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal; boat at bank2)
One missionary and one cannibal return from bank2 to bank1 in the boat.
(bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals; bank2: 1 missionary; boat at bank1)
Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
(bank1: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal; bank2: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals; boat at bank2)
One cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1 in the boat.
(bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals; bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal; boat at bank1)
Two missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
(bank1: 2 cannibals; bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal; boat at bank2)
The three missionaries at bank2 convert the one cannibal into a missionary.
(bank1: 2 cannibals; bank2: 4 missionaries; boat at bank2)
One missionary and one cannibal return from bank2 to bank1 in the boat.
(bank1: 1 missionary, 3 cannibals; bank2: 3 missionaries; boat at bank1)
Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
(bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal; bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals; boat at bank2)
One missionary returns from bank2 to bank1 in the boat.
(bank1: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal; bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals; boat at bank1)
Two missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
(bank1: 1 cannibal; bank2: 4 missionaries, 2 cannibals; boat at bank2)
One cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1 in the boat.
(bank1: 2 cannibals; bank2: 4 missionaries, 1 cannibal; boat at bank1)
Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
(bank1: empty; bank2: 4 missionaries, 3 cannibals; boat at bank2)
The four missionaries at bank2 convert the three cannibals into missionaries.
(bank1: empty; bank2: 7 missionaries; boat at bank2)

At the end of this plan, all missionaries and cannibals are at bank2, and the constraints are satisfied throughout the process.
