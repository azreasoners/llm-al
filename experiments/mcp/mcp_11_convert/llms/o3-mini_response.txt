Thought about missionaries and cannibals problem for 30 seconds
Analyzing the setup

I’m piecing together the initial conditions: 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals start on bank1, with all on-board the boat. Missionaries can convert a cannibal into a missionary, but crossing and converting can't happen simultaneously.

Strategizing the crossing

I’m figuring out how to ensure cannibals never outnumber missionaries at any time or place, including the boat, and that conversions happen effectively.

Refining the plan

OK, let me see. It seems that having three missionaries and one cannibal at the destination can speed things up, allowing more efficient boat trips.

Adjusting my strategy

I’m mapping out a plan using state notation (M, C, boat position) to ensure all missionaries and cannibals reach bank2, considering the impact of conversions on this outcome.

Revisiting the mission

Taking a closer look at whether the goal means keeping the original groups together, even if conversions have now removed some cannibals from the count.

Crafting a movement plan

I’m planning a sequence for crossing the boat safely and considering conversions when stationary to simplify the process. Each step will be methodically detailed.

Mapping out the exchange

Let's outline the steps: send 2 cannibals, return 1, send 2 again, and return 1 to bank1. This ensures missionaries aren't outnumbered by cannibals.

Assessing cannibal conversion

Considering if converting a cannibal to a missionary is wise, given the goal of safe transport without missionaries being outnumbered by cannibals.

Weighing conversion options

I’m thinking through whether cannibal conversion simplifies the crossing or complicates things, considering the final goal of safely transporting all individuals to bank2.

Evaluating conversion's role

I'm working through whether converting cannibals to missionaries simplifies the puzzle. The final goal is to ensure all reach bank2 safely, so conversion might be optional.

Navigating the puzzle

Considering the puzzle's constraints and the purpose of converting cannibals to missionaries, ensuring successful transport to bank2 considers puzzle rules and safety strategies.

Analyzing conversion impact

I’m examining how converting cannibals to missionaries might simplify crossing. The final goal is safe transport to bank2, considering puzzle rules and strategies.

Examining conversion's role

Considering how converting cannibals to missionaries might streamline crossing. The ultimate goal is safe transport to bank2, while adhering to puzzle rules and strategies.

Mapping the sequence

I’m charting a sequence to ensure safety, avoiding scenarios where cannibals outnumber missionaries. The goal is to transport everyone to bank2 securely.

Analyzing safety strategies

I’m exploring a classic solution for the 3,3 puzzle. It emphasizes safe crossovers to prevent cannibals from outnumbering missionaries on either bank.

Mapping the sequence

I’m examining a safe sequence for the 3,3 puzzle, ensuring missionaries and cannibals cross without safety conflicts on either bank, following established rules and strategies.

Strategizing safe crossings

I’m working through a sequence to ensure safe crossings, avoiding scenarios where cannibals outnumber missionaries. Exploring conversion to manage cannibal counts effectively.

Reassessing strategy

I’m pulling together conversion rules to manage cannibal counts and ensure safe crossings, thinking through scenarios to prevent unsafe conditions. This approach aims to streamline the solution process.

Crafting the strategy

I’m arranging the sequence to ensure safety, alternating movements and considering conversion options to manage cannibal counts effectively. This approach maintains balance and prevents unsafe conditions.

Balancing cannibals and missionaries

I’m ensuring safe crossings by optimizing movements and leveraging conversion opportunities to manage cannibal and missionary counts, aiming to maintain balance throughout the process.

Pinpointing strategy

I’m considering the strategic use of conversion to manage safe crossings, ensuring all missionaries and cannibals reach bank2 while maintaining the original cannibal count for the required move.

Evaluating conversion tactics

I'm leaning towards using conversion to secure safe crossings, considering its reversibility and its potential to aid missionaries and cannibals in reaching their destination.

Innovative strategy

I'm mapping out a plan to convert a cannibal to a missionary at bank1, making boat trips safer. This involves sending different combinations of missionaries and cannibals to optimize crossings.

Navigating the journey

I’m testing different combinations to ensure safe crossings, aiming to balance the cannibal and missionary counts initially, then send them in pairs or solos for progress.

Mapping progress

I’m testing different travel sequences to ensure safe ferrying of missionaries and cannibals, aiming for coordinated movements and optimized crossings while maintaining the initial count.

Reassessing the strategy

I'm re-evaluating the travel sequence to ensure the safety of missionaries and cannibals aboard the boat, aiming to maintain the initial population count for a successful crossing to bank2.

Refining tactics

Reassessing the strategy for ferrying missionaries and cannibals, converting one to a missionary, and sending the converted missionary back to bank2 to maintain the final goal.

Adapting to classic moves

I’m focusing on the standard solution for ferrying 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals with a 2-person boat, ensuring efficient crossings and avoiding unsafe states.

Crafting the sequence

I’m meticulously planning the sequence of boat trips to ensure the safety of missionaries and cannibals, verifying each step to avoid unsafe states during the crossing.

Evaluating safety parameters

I'm analyzing how missionaries and cannibals can breach safety rules on the boat and at each bank, noting that safe passage is crucial for all parties involved.

Below is one acceptable “plan‐script” that reaches the goal. (Note that although the problem “offers” the possibility of conversion, a safe plan exists that never needs to convert a cannibal into a missionary.) In what follows the state is described by

bank1: the number of missionaries (M) and cannibals (C) remaining on the starting bank,
bank2: the number of missionaries and cannibals already delivered,
and the boat’s location is indicated by the arrow “→” if it is on the right bank (bank2) or “←” if on the left bank (bank1).
The initial state is

Copy
bank1: 3M, 3C   ;   bank2: 0M, 0C   ;   Boat at bank1.
A valid solution is to make the following moves (each “move” is a river crossing; note that by “(x,y)” we mean x missionaries and y cannibals are in the boat):

Move 1: Send two cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

Boat load: (0,2)
Resulting state:
bank1: 3M, 1C  bank2: 0M, 2C  Boat at bank2.
Move 2: Return one cannibal from bank2 to bank1.

Boat load: (0,1)
Resulting state:
bank1: 3M, 2C  bank2: 0M, 1C  Boat at bank1.
Move 3: Send two cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

Boat load: (0,2)
Resulting state:
bank1: 3M, 0C  bank2: 0M, 3C  Boat at bank2.
Move 4: Return one cannibal from bank2 to bank1.

Boat load: (0,1)
Resulting state:
bank1: 3M, 1C  bank2: 0M, 2C  Boat at bank1.
Move 5: Send two missionaries from bank1 to bank2.

Boat load: (2,0)
Resulting state:
bank1: 1M, 1C  bank2: 2M, 2C  Boat at bank2.
(Check: At bank1, 1M is not outnumbered by 1C; at bank2, 2M ≥ 2C.)
Move 6: Return one missionary and one cannibal from bank2 to bank1.

Boat load: (1,1)
Resulting state:
bank1: 2M, 2C  bank2: 1M, 1C  Boat at bank1.
Move 7: Send two missionaries from bank1 to bank2.

Boat load: (2,0)
Resulting state:
bank1: 0M, 2C  bank2: 3M, 1C  Boat at bank2.
(At bank2, 3M ≥ 1C; bank1 has only cannibals, which is safe.)
Move 8: Return one cannibal from bank2 to bank1.

Boat load: (0,1)
Resulting state:
bank1: 0M, 3C  bank2: 3M, 0C  Boat at bank1.
Move 9: Send two cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

Boat load: (0,2)
Resulting state:
bank1: 0M, 1C  bank2: 3M, 2C  Boat at bank2.
Move 10: Return one cannibal from bank2 to bank1.

Boat load: (0,1)
Resulting state:
bank1: 0M, 2C  bank2: 3M, 1C  Boat at bank1.
Move 11: Send the final two cannibals from bank1 to bank2.

Boat load: (0,2)
Resulting state:
bank1: 0M, 0C  bank2: 3M, 3C  Boat at bank2.
At the end all 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals are safely at bank2.

A Few Remarks
Safety conditions: At every step the numbers on each bank obey the rule that if any missionaries are present then their number is not less than the number of cannibals.
Boat conditions: In every crossing the boat carries at least one person and never loads cannibals in numbers that would “outnumber” the missionaries onboard.
Conversion option: Although the problem statement tells us that “three missionaries alone with a cannibal can convert him into a missionary,” note that in this plan conversion is not used at all. (It is available as an extra tool should one wish to design an alternative plan—but the classic 3–3 problem with a two‐person boat is solvable without it.)
This sequence is one acceptable answer. (There exist several alternative solutions.)
