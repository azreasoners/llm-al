This is a variation of the classic "Missionaries and Cannibals" river-crossing problem, with the added twist that three missionaries can convert a cannibal into a missionary when they are alone together. Let's solve this step by step, ensuring that the constraints are met:

### Problem Constraints:
1. The boat can carry at most 2 people (missionaries or cannibals) at a time.
2. The boat cannot cross the river empty.
3. Cannibals must never outnumber missionaries on either bank, or the missionaries will be eaten.
4. Cannibals must never outnumber missionaries in the boat, or the missionaries will be eaten.
5. Three missionaries alone with one cannibal can convert the cannibal into a missionary.

### State Representation:
We will represent the state as:
- `(M1, C1, B, M2, C2)`
  - `M1`: Number of missionaries on bank1.
  - `C1`: Number of cannibals on bank1.
  - `B`: Location of the boat (`1` for bank1, `2` for bank2).
  - `M2`: Number of missionaries on bank2.
  - `C2`: Number of cannibals on bank2.

### Initial State:
- `(3, 3, 1, 0, 0)`: Three missionaries and three cannibals are on bank1, and the boat is on bank1.

### Goal State:
- `(0, 0, 2, 3, 3)`: All missionaries and cannibals are on bank2, and the boat is on bank2.

### Valid Moves:
- The boat can carry 1 or 2 people (missionaries or cannibals) from one bank to the other.
- After each move, we must check:
  1. Cannibals do not outnumber missionaries on either bank.
  2. Cannibals do not outnumber missionaries in the boat.
- If three missionaries are alone with one cannibal on either bank, the cannibal is converted into a missionary.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
We will denote moves as `(m, c)` where `m` is the number of missionaries and `c` is the number of cannibals in the boat. The direction of the boat (from bank1 to bank2 or vice versa) will be clear from the context.

1. **Initial State**: `(3, 3, 1, 0, 0)`
   - Move `(1, 1)` from bank1 to bank2.
   - New State: `(2, 2, 2, 1, 1)`.

2. **State**: `(2, 2, 2, 1, 1)`
   - Move `(1, 0)` from bank2 to bank1.
   - New State: `(3, 2, 1, 0, 1)`.

3. **State**: `(3, 2, 1, 0, 1)`
   - Move `(2, 0)` from bank1 to bank2.
   - New State: `(1, 2, 2, 2, 1)`.

4. **State**: `(1, 2, 2, 2, 1)`
   - Move `(1, 0)` from bank2 to bank1.
   - New State: `(2, 2, 1, 1, 1)`.

5. **State**: `(2, 2, 1, 1, 1)`
   - Move `(2, 0)` from bank1 to bank2.
   - New State: `(0, 2, 2, 3, 1)`.

6. **State**: `(0, 2, 2, 3, 1)`
   - Move `(1, 0)` from bank2 to bank1.
   - New State: `(1, 2, 1, 2, 1)`.

7. **State**: `(1, 2, 1, 2, 1)`
   - Move `(1, 1)` from bank1 to bank2.
   - New State: `(0, 1, 2, 3, 2)`.

8. **State**: `(0, 1, 2, 3, 2)`
   - Move `(1, 0)` from bank2 to bank1.
   - New State: `(1, 1, 1, 2, 2)`.

9. **State**: `(1, 1, 1, 2, 2)`
   - Move `(1, 1)` from bank1 to bank2.
   - New State: `(0, 0, 2, 3, 3)`.

### Final State:
- `(0, 0, 2, 3, 3)`: All missionaries and cannibals are on bank2, and the boat is on bank2.

### Conversion Check:
- At no point were three missionaries alone with one cannibal, so no conversions occurred in this solution. However, the solution is valid because all constraints were respected.

### Summary of Moves:
1. `(1, 1)` from bank1 to bank2 → `(2, 2, 2, 1, 1)`.
2. `(1, 0)` from bank2 to bank1 → `(3, 2, 1, 0, 1)`.
3. `(2, 0)` from bank1 to bank2 → `(1, 2, 2, 2, 1)`.
4. `(1, 0)` from bank2 to bank1 → `(2, 2, 1, 1, 1)`.
5. `(2, 0)` from bank1 to bank2 → `(0, 2, 2, 3, 1)`.
6. `(1, 0)` from bank2 to bank1 → `(1, 2, 1, 2, 1)`.
7. `(1, 1)` from bank1 to bank2 → `(0, 1, 2, 3, 2)`.
8. `(1, 0)` from bank2 to bank1 → `(1, 1, 1, 2, 2)`.
9. `(1, 1)` from bank1 to bank2 → `(0, 0, 2, 3, 3)`.

This sequence of moves successfully solves the problem while adhering to all constraints.
