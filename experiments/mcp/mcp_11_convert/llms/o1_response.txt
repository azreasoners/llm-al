Thought about missionaries and cannibals puzzle for 1m 18s
Navigating constraints

I'm tackling the "Missionaries and Cannibals" puzzle with a boat that holds up to 2, ensuring missionaries aren't outnumbered by cannibals. The twist is converting a cannibal to a missionary when 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal are together.

Maximizing fewer crossings

I'm figuring out how to use the 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal conversion to cut down on boat trips while handling the main constraints of missionary and cannibal safety.

Strategizing the conversion

I’m working through the challenge of converting a cannibal to a missionary on bank1 or bank2, given the boat's restriction of carrying only 2 individuals at a time.

Charting the course

Considering the standard mission strategy, taking 2 cannibals without missionaries is an option. Now, I’m figuring out how to apply the new rule for optimizing boat trips.

Focusing on constraints

I'm working through boat trip strategies, ensuring cannibals don't outnumber missionaries and considering moving 2 cannibals without missionaries when missionaries are present.

Ensuring safety

I'm refining the boat trip plan to prevent cannibals from outnumbering missionaries, confirming the boat's safe capacity each time. This approach seems promising for meeting the constraints.

Adjusting my approach

Ensuring a balanced boat trip plan by verifying each step's safety, especially under the extra constraint. It's interesting to see how careful planning is essential here.

Rethinking safety

I'm re-evaluating the sequence to prevent missionaries from being outnumbered. Ensuring fairness and safety on all sides is paramount, and the ship's capacity is carefully tracked each time.

Reevaluating the plan

I'm digging into a well-known solution for the "Missionaries and Cannibals" puzzle with boat capacity 2, including steps to ensure safety and optimizing maneuvering for conversion.

Ensuring minimal trips

I’m taking a closer look at ferrying M and C groups to make the fewest trips and keep them safe. Each movement is crucial for maintaining balance on both sides.

Balancing the trip

I’m weighing the safety of the missionaries and cannibals on both sides of the boat while aiming to make the trip count effectively.

Considering different options

I’m thinking through the safety of sending 1M or 1C back. Each choice needs careful balancing to ensure missionaries aren’t outnumbered by cannibals.

Converting cannibals

I'm figuring out how to convert a cannibal into a missionary by isolating 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal on one side, then modifying the puzzle to suit the new rule.

Analyzing conversion rules

I’m digging into whether "three missionaries alone with a cannibal" impacts the solution. This suggests isolating 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal together.

Charting the course

OK, let’s ensure safety: first, ferry 2 cannibals to the right side. Then, return 1 cannibal to keep the boat balanced. This approach should maintain a safe parity.

Structuring the approach

I’m piecing together a strategy to place 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal together while keeping the boat balanced, ensuring all safety constraints are met throughout the journey.

Strategizing solutions

I’m working through various combinations to efficiently ferry 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals, ensuring the boat's limited capacity keeps them balanced on both sides.

Evaluating ferry trips

Mapping out the sequence of ferrying 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals, ensuring all safety constraints are met, and exploring the potential for converting a cannibal with the new rule.

Evaluating ferrying tactics

Working through a cycle of ferrying 2 cannibals to the right, followed by returning 1 cannibal, ensures safety and balance across both sides.

Navigating constraints

I’m piecing together ferrying tactics while ensuring missionaries and cannibals are balanced. The new rule of conversion might simplify the process, but safekeeping is the priority.

Ferrying carefully

I’m noting that ferrying 2M to the right might breach constraints. Moving 1M and 1C together could work better, keeping the journey safe and balanced.

Crafting the strategy

Mapping out how to convert a cannibal to a missionary by placing 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal together with no other cannibals or missionaries around.

Optimizing ferry trips

I’m mapping out how to ferry 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal together, then return the cannibal to ensure safety and leverage the conversion rule for minimal boat trips.

Adjusting my approach

I’m working on ensuring safety by managing boat balance and using the conversion rule to minimize trips, while meticulously balancing missionaries and cannibals on both sides.

Crafting the path

Ensuring safety, I’m taking 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal to one side, returning a cannibal for balance, and optimizing boat trips to include the conversion rule.

Simplifying the journey

I’m converting a cannibal into a missionary, reducing cannibals to 2 and missionaries to 4, which makes the puzzle’s setup easier to manage.

Piecing together the plan

I’m optimizing boat trips, ensuring safety with 4 missionaries and 2 cannibals, and efficiently using the conversion rule to streamline movements.

Ensuring equilibrium

OK, let's stream the balancing act of ferrying 4 missionaries and 2 cannibals, keeping them safe and using the conversion rule to minimize trips while making everything work smoothly.

Crafting the approach

I’m pulling together a plan to ferry 4 missionaries and 2 cannibals while keeping everyone safe, using boat trips strategically and applying the conversion rule to simplify the process.

Advancing the strategy

I’m considering ferrying 4 missionaries and 2 cannibals back and forth to ensure safety, using the boat's capacity wisely while keeping everyone balanced.

Strategizing boat movements

I’m considering simpler ways to ferry 4 missionaries and 2 cannibals, ensuring safety with boat trips and conversions. Each movement needs careful balancing to avoid missionaries being outnumbered.

Balancing safety

I’m laying out the steps to ferry 4 missionaries and 2 cannibals, ensuring boat capacity and parity are managed to keep everyone safe from being outnumbered.

Ferrying and balancing

I'm ensuring the boat carries 2 missionaries and returns safely, maintains parity on both sides, and leverages the conversion rule to optimize ferrying 4 missionaries and 2 cannibals.

Ensuring stability

I'm confirming that this method keeps everyone balanced and safe, strategically managing boat trips and missionaries to prevent any side from being outnumbered by cannibals.

Balancing the boat

I’m working through ferrying 4 missionaries and 2 cannibals, factoring in boat capacity, ensuring parity is maintained, and leveraging the conversion rule to streamline movements.

Refining the strategy

Ensuring safety by ferrying 4 missionaries and 2 cannibals, carefully managing boat trips and maintaining parity between sides, while meticulously tracking cannibals to avoid outnumbering.

Navigating configurations

I’m noting that both 4M, 2C and 3M, 2C on the right side are safe. The tricky part is ensuring these groups are managed correctly during boat trips.

Below is one systematic way to get all three missionaries and all three cannibals from bank1 to bank2 under the stated rules:

The boat can carry at most 2 people.
We can never leave missionaries outnumbered by cannibals (on a bank or on the boat).
If ever exactly 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal are alone together on a bank (i.e.\ no other missionaries/cannibals there), that 1 cannibal is converted into a missionary.
Key idea of the solution
First, isolate one cannibal with the three missionaries on one bank (with no other cannibals there).
As soon as there are 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal alone on a bank, that cannibal is converted into a missionary.
After the conversion, you effectively have 4 missionaries and 2 cannibals total. From there, ferrying everyone across becomes a more standard “missionaries and cannibals” procedure—but with 4 missionaries instead of 3.
In what follows, I’ll call the two banks Left (bank1) and Right (bank2). We start with:

Left bank: 3M, 3C, and the boat
Right bank: 0M, 0C
Our goal is:

Left bank: 0M, 0C
Right bank: 3M, 3C
while obeying all the safety and conversion rules.

Step-by-step plan
I will write moves in the form

Initially:

Left = 3M, 3C, Boat
Right = 0M, 0C
1) Take two cannibals over

(0M,2C) : Left → Right
Left now has 3M, 1C.
Right now has 0M, 2C.
Boat is on the Right.
Check safety:

Left: 3M vs 1C ⇒ 3 ≥ 1, safe.
Right: 0M vs 2C ⇒ 0 missionaries, so no one gets eaten, safe.
2) Bring one cannibal back

Boat is on the Left.
Check safety:

Right: 0M vs 1C ⇒ 0 missionaries, so no issue, safe.
3) Take two cannibals over again

(0M,2C) : Left → Right

Right now has 0M, 3C.
Boat is on the Right.
Check safety:

Left: 3M, 0C ⇒ obviously safe.
Right: 0M, 3C ⇒ no missionaries to be eaten, safe.
4) Bring one cannibal back
mathematica
Copy
Edit
(0M,1C) : Right → Left
Left now has 3M, 1C.
Right now has 0M, 2C.
Boat is on the Left.
Now on the Left bank we have exactly 3M and 1C, with no other people there. By the special rule:

“Three missionaries alone with a cannibal can convert him into a missionary.”

that 1 cannibal on the Left is immediately converted.

So effectively, Left becomes 4M, 0C.
Right remains 0M, 2C.
From this point onward we have 4 missionaries total and 2 cannibals total.

After the conversion
Now the problem reduces to:

Left = 4M
Right = 2C
Boat on the Left
and we still must ensure no side ever has missionaries outnumbered by cannibals.

5) Take two missionaries across

Left: 2M,0C ⇒ safe.
Right: 2M,2C ⇒ tie (2M ≥ 2C), safe.
6) Bring one cannibal back

Right: 2M vs 1C ⇒ safe (2 ≥ 1).
7) Take two missionaries across again

Right: 4M,1C ⇒ 4 ≥ 1, safe.
8) Bring one missionary back

Right: 3M,1C

Right: 3M vs 1C ⇒ 3 ≥ 1, safe.
9) Finally, bring that last missionary and cannibal across
mathematica
Copy
Edit
(1M,1C) : Left → Right
Left: 0M, 0C
Right: 4M, 2C
Everyone is now on the Right (bank2), which was the goal.

Final outcome
We started with 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals on bank1.
We ended with all 6 people on bank2, with one of the original cannibals having been converted into a missionary (so effectively 4 missionaries, 2 cannibals).
At no point did cannibals outnumber missionaries on a bank or on the boat.
The boat was never sent empty.
Hence this satisfies all of the puzzle’s constraints and uses the special “3M + 1C ⇒ convert” rule exactly once.
