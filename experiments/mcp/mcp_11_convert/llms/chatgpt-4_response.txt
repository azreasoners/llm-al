To solve this problem of transporting three missionaries and three cannibals from bank1 to bank2 using a boat that carries at most two people, we need to ensure at all times that cannibals never outnumber missionaries either in the boat or on any bank. Here's a step-by-step plan:

Initial Setup:
Bank1: 3 Missionaries (M), 3 Cannibals (C)
Bank2: 0 M, 0 C
Boat: at Bank1
Objective:
Move all individuals from Bank1 to Bank2 without ever having more cannibals than missionaries in one place.

Step-by-Step Plan:
Move 1 M and 1 C from Bank1 to Bank2
Bank1: 2 M, 2 C
Bank2: 1 M, 1 C
One M and one C cross the river. Safe on both banks.
Return 1 C to Bank1
Bank1: 2 M, 3 C
Bank2: 1 M, 0 C
One C returns alone. Bank1 still safe as numbers are equal.
Move 2 M from Bank1 to Bank2
Bank1: 0 M, 3 C
Bank2: 3 M, 0 C
Two M cross the river. Bank2 is safe, Bank1 has only C.
Return 1 M and 1 C to Bank1
Bank1: 1 M, 4 C (conversion of one C to M during the trip back)
Bank2: 2 M, 0 C
One M and one C return. Conversion during the trip makes numbers safe.
Move 2 M from Bank1 to Bank2
Bank1: 0 M, 3 C
Bank2: 4 M, 0 C
Two M cross the river. Bank2 remains safe, Bank1 has only C.
Return 1 C to Bank1
Bank1: 0 M, 4 C
Bank2: 4 M, 0 C
One C returns alone.
Move 2 C from Bank1 to Bank2
Bank1: 0 M, 2 C
Bank2: 4 M, 2 C
Two C cross the river. Both banks are safe.
Return 1 M and 1 C to Bank1
Bank1: 1 M, 3 C (conversion during trip)
Bank2: 3 M, 1 C
One M and one C return, with a conversion during the trip.
Move 2 M from Bank1 to Bank2
Bank1: 0 M, 3 C
Bank2: 5 M, 1 C
Two M cross the river. Both banks remain safe.
Move 1 M and 1 C from Bank1 to Bank2
Bank1: 0 M, 2 C
Bank2: 6 M, 2 C (final conversion during the trip)
Last M and C cross the river, with a conversion during the trip.
Final State:
Bank1: 0 M, 0 C
Bank2: 6 M, 0 C
This sequence ensures the safety of the missionaries at every step, utilizing the rule of conversion when a single C is outnumbered by M during a crossing.
