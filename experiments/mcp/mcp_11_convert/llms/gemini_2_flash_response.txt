Here's a solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, considering the added rule about conversion:

Initial State:

Bank 1: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat
Bank 2: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
Moves (M = Missionary, C = Cannibal):

Bank 1 to Bank 2: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal (Bank 1: 2M, 2C; Bank 2: 1M, 1C)
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 Missionary (Bank 1: 3M, 2C; Bank 2: 0M, 1C)
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 Cannibals (Bank 1: 3M, 0C; Bank 2: 0M, 3C)
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 Cannibal (Bank 1: 3M, 1C; Bank 2: 0M, 2C)
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 Missionaries (Bank 1: 1M, 1C; Bank 2: 2M, 2C)
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal (Bank 1: 2M, 2C; Bank 2: 1M, 1C)
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 Missionaries (Bank 1: 0M, 2C; Bank 2: 3M, 2C)
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 Cannibal (Bank 1: 0M, 3C; Bank 2: 3M, 1C)
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 Cannibals (Bank 1: 0M, 1C; Bank 2: 3M, 3C)
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 Cannibal (Bank 1: 0M, 2C; Bank 2: 3M, 2C)
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 1 Missionary, 1 Cannibal (Bank 1: 1M, 1C; Bank 2: 2M, 2C)
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 Missionary (Bank 1: 2M, 1C; Bank 2: 1M, 2C)
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 Missionaries (Bank 1: 0M, 1C; Bank 2: 3M, 2C)
Bank 2 to Bank 1: 1 Cannibal (Bank 1: 0M, 2C; Bank 2: 3M, 1C)
Bank 1 to Bank 2: 2 Cannibals (Bank 1: 0M, 0C; Bank 2: 3M, 3C)
Final State:

Bank 1: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
Bank 2: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals
This solution adheres to all the rules:

The boat never travels empty.
Cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
All missionaries and cannibals are successfully transported to Bank 2.
The conversion rule is not needed to solve this classic version of the puzzle. It only becomes relevant if you have a larger number of missionaries/cannibals, or different boat capacities.
Let me know if you'd like to explore variations of this problem with different numbers or boat sizes!
