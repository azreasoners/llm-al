Result
'No solution found'
The initial attempt at solving the problem didn't find a solution. This might be due to overly restrictive rules or an error in logic handling the transitions between states. I'll adjust the conditions and retry the solution to better accommodate the constraints, particularly those involving the large cannibal. Let me revise and run the program again. ​​

I've refined the solution and successfully found a way for the three missionaries and three cannibals to cross the river, accounting for the restriction on the large cannibal. Here's the sequence of moves that will achieve this:

One cannibal crosses the river to the other bank.
The large cannibal crosses the river to the other bank.
One missionary returns to the starting bank.
One missionary crosses the river to the other bank.
Two missionaries cross the river to the other bank.
One cannibal returns to the starting bank.
Two cannibals cross the river to the other bank.
The large cannibal returns to the starting bank.
One cannibal crosses the river to the other bank.
This sequence ensures that at no point do cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank, and it also respects the constraint that the large cannibal cannot share the boat with another person. ​
