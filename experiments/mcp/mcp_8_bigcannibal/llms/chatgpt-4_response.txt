To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that allows all three missionaries (M) and three cannibals (C), including the big cannibal, to safely cross from bank1 to bank2. The boat has a capacity for two but the big cannibal counts as two due to his size. Let's outline a strategy that considers all these constraints and achieves the goal without violating the rules:

Initial setup:
bank1: 3M, 3C (1 big cannibal)
bank2: 0M, 0C
boat at bank1
Rules to follow:
Cannibals may never outnumber missionaries at any location.
At most two can ride the boat at any one time.
The big cannibal occupies the boat alone due to his size.
Step-by-Step Solution
Move 1
Action: Big cannibal crosses to bank2.
bank1: 3M, 2C
bank2: 0M, 1C (big)
boat at bank2
Move 2
Action: Big cannibal returns to bank1.
bank1: 3M, 3C
bank2: 0M, 0C
boat at bank1
Move 3
Action: Two small cannibals cross to bank2.
bank1: 3M, 1C
bank2: 0M, 2C (big cannibal not counted here)
boat at bank2
Move 4
Action: One small cannibal returns to bank1.
bank1: 3M, 2C
bank2: 0M, 1C
boat at bank1
Move 5
Action: Two missionaries cross to bank2.
bank1: 1M, 2C
bank2: 2M, 1C
boat at bank2
Move 6
Action: One missionary and one small cannibal return to bank1.
bank1: 2M, 3C
bank2: 1M, 0C
boat at bank1
Move 7
Action: Two missionaries cross to bank2.
bank1: 0M, 3C
bank2: 3M, 0C
boat at bank2
Move 8
Action: Big cannibal crosses to bank2.
bank1: 0M, 2C
bank2: 3M, 1C (big)
boat at bank2
Move 9
Action: Big cannibal returns to bank1.
bank1: 0M, 3C
bank2: 3M, 0C
boat at bank1
Move 10
Action: Two small cannibals cross to bank2.
bank1: 0M, 1C
bank2: 3M, 2C
boat at bank2
Move 11
Action: Big cannibal crosses to bank2, completing the transfer.
bank1: 0M, 0C
bank2: 3M, 3C
boat at bank2
This sequence of moves ensures that at no point do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank or in the boat, and everyone successfully crosses to bank2.
