This problem can be solved using a systematic approach like state-space search or an AI planning algorithm, such as breadth-first search (BFS). Here's a formalized version of the problem:

Problem Definition
Entities
Vessel: boat (capacity: 2)
Locations: bank1, bank2
Groups: missionaries, cannibals, big_cannibal
Integers: Represent counts of missionaries, cannibals, and big cannibals on each bank.
Initial State
bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals, 1 big cannibal, and the boat.
bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals, 0 big cannibals.
Goal State
bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals, and 1 big cannibal.
bank1: Empty.
Rules and Constraints
The boat can carry a maximum of 2 people.
The boat cannot cross empty.
The missionaries on either bank (or in the boat) must not be outnumbered by the cannibals.
missionaries
≥
cannibals (if missionaries > 0)
missionaries≥cannibals (if missionaries > 0)
The big cannibal cannot share the boat with another person.
All transitions must be valid under these constraints.

Valid Moves
The boat can carry:

One missionary.
One cannibal.
One big cannibal.
Two missionaries.
Two cannibals.
Moves must satisfy the constraints mentioned above.

Plan Search (Algorithm Outline)
State Exploration: Use BFS to explore all possible transitions starting from the initial state.
Check Validity: Ensure each move satisfies the constraints.
Mark Visited States: Avoid revisiting states to reduce computation.
Reach Goal State: Stop when the goal state is achieved.
