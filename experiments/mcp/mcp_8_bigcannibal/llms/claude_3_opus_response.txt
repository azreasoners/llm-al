Here's a step-by-step plan to safely transport the three missionaries and three cannibals across the river from bank1 to bank2:

1 missionary and 1 cannibal cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
The cannibal returns to bank1 alone in the boat.
2 cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
1 missionary and 1 cannibal return to bank1 in the boat.
2 missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
1 cannibal returns to bank1 alone in the boat.
2 cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
1 cannibal returns to bank1 alone in the boat.
The big cannibal crosses from bank1 to bank2 alone in the boat.
1 missionary returns to bank1 alone in the boat.
2 missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.
At the end of this sequence, all three missionaries and all three cannibals (including the big cannibal) will be at bank2, and the boat will also be at bank2.

Throughout this process, the number of cannibals never exceeds the number of missionaries on either bank or in the boat, ensuring the safety of the missionaries.
