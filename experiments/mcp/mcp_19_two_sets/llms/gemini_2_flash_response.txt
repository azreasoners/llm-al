Here's a plan to solve the doubled missionaries and cannibals problem. Because the two sets are independent, we can solve the standard missionaries and cannibals problem twice. Here's a solution for one set, which you can then apply to the second set simultaneously:

Key:

M = Missionary
C = Cannibal
B = Boat
Bank 1 = Starting side
Bank 2 = Destination side
Steps (for one set):

Bank 1: MMMCCC B
Bank 2:
Boat: 2C

Bank 1: MMM C
Bank 2: CC B
Boat: 1C

Bank 1: MMM CC
Bank 2: C B
Boat: 2M

Bank 1: M CC
Bank 2: MMM B
Boat: 1M

Bank 1: MM CC B
Bank 2: MM
Boat: 2C

Bank 1: MM
Bank 2: MM CC B
Boat: 1C

Bank 1: M C
Bank 2: MMM C B
Boat: 2M

Bank 1: C
Bank 2: MMM CC B
Boat: 1C

Bank 1: CC B
Bank 2: MMM
Boat: 2C

Bank 1:
Bank 2: MMMCCC B

Explanation and Application to the Doubled Problem:

Safety: At no point on either bank or in the boat do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries.
Boat Capacity: The boat never carries more than two people.
Simultaneous Solution: Because the two sets don't interact, you perform these exact steps simultaneously for both sets. So, in step 1, both boats carry two cannibals across. In step 2, both boats bring one cannibal back, and so on.
Representing with your defined types:

Vessel: boat1 (and boat2 for the second set, though the solution is the same)
Locations: bank1, bank2
Groups: missionaries, cannibals
Integers: These represent the number of missionaries and cannibals. You start with 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals on bank1 for each set. The steps above implicitly show the changing integers at each location. For example, after step 1, bank1 has 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal (integers 3 and 1), while bank2 has 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals (integers 0 and 2).
Therefore, by applying the above 10 steps to both sets concurrently, you successfully move all missionaries and cannibals from bank1 to bank2 for both sets without any missionaries being eaten.
