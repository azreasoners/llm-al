The problem you describe is a variant of the classic "Missionaries and Cannibals" problem, with the added complexity that it's being solved twice simultaneously but independently. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve each set separately. The boat can carry at most two people and must always carry at least one person to cross the river. Here, I'll describe how to solve it for one set, and the same solution can be applied independently to the other set.

Step-by-Step Plan for One Set
We start with 3 missionaries (M) and 3 cannibals (C) on bank1 (starting bank), and the boat also on bank1. The goal is to get all six to bank2 (destination bank) without ever having more cannibals than missionaries on either bank or on the boat.

bank1: 3M, 3C | bank2: 0M, 0C
Move 1M and 1C to bank2.
bank1: 2M, 2C | bank2: 1M, 1C
Bring 1C back to bank1.
bank1: 2M, 3C | bank2: 1M, 0C
Move 2C to bank2.
bank1: 2M, 1C | bank2: 1M, 2C
Bring 1M and 1C back to bank1.
bank1: 3M, 2C | bank2: 0M, 2C
Move 2M to bank2.
bank1: 1M, 2C | bank2: 2M, 2C
Bring 1M and 1C back to bank1.
bank1: 2M, 3C | bank2: 1M, 1C
Move 2C to bank2.
bank1: 2M, 1C | bank2: 1M, 3C
Bring 1C back to bank1.
bank1: 2M, 2C | bank2: 1M, 2C
Move 2M to bank2.
bank1: 0M, 2C | bank2: 3M, 2C
Bring 1C back to bank1.
bank1: 0M, 3C | bank2: 3M, 1C
Move 2C to bank2.
bank1: 0M, 1C | bank2: 3M, 3C
Bring 1C back to bank1.
bank1: 0M, 2C | bank2: 3M, 2C
Move 2C to bank2.
Finally, the configuration is:

bank1: 0M, 0C | bank2: 3M, 3C
This solution needs to be replicated for the second set, which you mentioned is independent but identical to the first. This will achieve the goal for both sets simultaneously.
