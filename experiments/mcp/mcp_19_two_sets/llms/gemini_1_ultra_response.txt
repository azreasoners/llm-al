Absolutely! This is a classic logic puzzle with an interesting twist. Here's how we can approach the solution, keeping in mind that we have two independent sets of missionaries and cannibals:

Understanding the Constraints

Boat Capacity: The boat can only carry two individuals at a time.
Cannibal Rule: Cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
Boat Movement: The boat cannot move by itself; it needs at least one person on board.
Independent Sets: The two sets of missionaries and cannibals don't interact. We need to solve each one separately.
Basic Solution (for one set)

Two Cannibals Cross: Two cannibals cross the river.
One Cannibal Returns: One cannibal brings the boat back.
Two Missionaries Cross: Two missionaries cross the river.
One Missionary and One Cannibal Return: One missionary and one cannibal bring the boat back.
Two Cannibals Cross: Two cannibals cross again.
One Cannibal Returns: One cannibal brings the boat back.
Two Missionaries Cross: Two missionaries cross.
One Cannibal Returns: One cannibal brings the boat back.
Two Cannibals Cross: The final two cannibals cross the river.
Doubled Solution

Since the sets are independent, we simply perform the above sequence of steps for both sets simultaneously.  Here's how it would look, assuming we use the labels "M1" and "C1" for the first set, and "M2" and "C2" for the second set:

C1, C1 and C2, C2 Cross: Two cannibals from each set cross the river.
C1 and C2 Return: One cannibal from each set returns.
M1, M1 and M2, M2 Cross: Two missionaries from each set cross.
M1, C1 and M2, C2 Return: One missionary and one cannibal from each set return. ...and so on, following the rest of the basic solution steps for both sets.
Important Note: The key to solving this doubled version is to realize that the actions within each set don't affect the other set.
