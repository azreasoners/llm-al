This is a complex problem that involves solving two independent instances of the classic "Missionaries and Cannibals" problem simultaneously. Since the two sets do not interact, we can solve each instance separately, but the overall solution must account for both sets. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

---

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Entities and Types**:
   - **Vessel**: `boat1` (for each set, we have one boat).
   - **Location**: `bank1` (starting side) and `bank2` (destination side).
   - **Group**: `missionaries` and `cannibals` (each set has 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals).
   - **Set**: Two independent sets (Set 1 and Set 2), each with its own missionaries, cannibals, and boat.
   - **Integer**: Used to track the number of missionaries and cannibals at each location or in the boat (0 to 10, but in this case, we deal with 0 to 3 for each group in each set).

2. **Constraints**:
   - The boat can carry at most 2 people (missionaries or cannibals) at a time.
   - The boat cannot cross the river empty.
   - At no point can cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank (or they will eat the missionaries).
   - At no point can cannibals outnumber missionaries in the boat (or they will eat the missionaries).
   - The two sets are independent, so the state of one set does not affect the other.

3. **Initial State (for each set)**:
   - At `bank1`: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, and the boat.
   - At `bank2`: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals.

4. **Goal State (for each set)**:
   - At `bank1`: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals.
   - At `bank2`: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, and the boat.

5. **State Representation**:
   - For each set, we represent the state as `(M1, C1, B, M2, C2)` where:
     - `M1`: Number of missionaries on `bank1`.
     - `C1`: Number of cannibals on `bank1`.
     - `B`: Location of the boat (`bank1` or `bank2`).
     - `M2`: Number of missionaries on `bank2`.
     - `C2`: Number of cannibals on `bank2`.
   - Initial state: `(3, 3, bank1, 0, 0)`.
   - Goal state: `(0, 0, bank2, 3, 3)`.

6. **Rules for Valid Moves**:
   - The boat can carry 1 or 2 people (missionaries or cannibals).
   - After each move, the number of cannibals must not exceed the number of missionaries on either bank or in the boat (unless there are no missionaries present).
   - The boat changes location after each move (from `bank1` to `bank2` or vice versa).

### Solving the Problem for One Set:
The classic "Missionaries and Cannibals" problem with 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, and a boat capacity of 2 has a well-known solution. We need to find a sequence of moves that satisfies all constraints. Let's solve it for one set first, and then apply the same solution to both sets.

#### Key Observations:
- The critical constraint is ensuring that cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
- We need to alternate trips to balance the number of missionaries and cannibals on both banks.
- A valid solution involves 11 trips for each set.

#### Solution for One Set:
We denote a move as `(M, C) -> direction`, where:
- `M` is the number of missionaries in the boat.
- `C` is the number of cannibals in the boat.
- `direction` is `bank1 -> bank2` or `bank2 -> bank1`.

The sequence of moves for one set is as follows:

1. **Initial State**: `(3, 3, bank1, 0, 0)`.
   - Move `(0, 2) -> bank1 -> bank2`.
   - New State: `(3, 1, bank2, 0, 2)`.

2. **State**: `(3, 1, bank2, 0, 2)`.
   - Move `(0, 1) -> bank2 -> bank1`.
   - New State: `(3, 2, bank1, 0, 1)`.

3. **State**: `(3, 2, bank1, 0, 1)`.
   - Move `(0, 2) -> bank1 -> bank2`.
   - New State: `(3, 0, bank2, 0, 3)`.

4. **State**: `(3, 0, bank2, 0, 3)`.
   - Move `(0, 1) -> bank2 -> bank1`.
   - New State: `(3, 1, bank1, 0, 2)`.

5. **State**: `(3, 1, bank1, 0, 2)`.
   - Move `(2, 0) -> bank1 -> bank2`.
   - New State: `(1, 1, bank2, 2, 2)`.

6. **State**: `(1, 1, bank2, 2, 2)`.
   - Move `(1, 1) -> bank2 -> bank1`.
   - New State: `(2, 2, bank1, 1, 1)`.

7. **State**: `(2, 2, bank1, 1, 1)`.
   - Move `(2, 0) -> bank1 -> bank2`.
   - New State: `(0, 2, bank2, 3, 1)`.

8. **State**: `(0, 2, bank2, 3, 1)`.
   - Move `(0, 1) -> bank2 -> bank1`.
   - New State: `(0, 3, bank1, 3, 0)`.

9. **State**: `(0, 3, bank1, 3, 0)`.
   - Move `(0, 2) -> bank1 -> bank2`.
   - New State: `(0, 1, bank2, 3, 2)`.

10. **State**: `(0, 1, bank2, 3, 2)`.
    - Move `(0, 1) -> bank2 -> bank1`.
    - New State: `(0, 2, bank1, 3, 1)`.

11. **State**: `(0, 2, bank1, 3, 1)`.
    - Move `(0, 2) -> bank1 -> bank2`.
    - New State: `(0, 0, bank2, 3, 3)`.

**Goal State Reached**: `(0, 0, bank2, 3, 3)`.

### Solving for Both Sets:
Since the two sets are independent, we can apply the same sequence of moves to both Set 1 and Set 2. The moves for each set do not interact, so we can execute them in parallel or sequentially.

#### Final Plan:
For both Set 1 and Set 2, follow the 11-step sequence described above. The plan can be summarized as follows:

- **Set 1 Moves**:
  1. `(0, 2) -> bank1 -> bank2`.
  2. `(0, 1) -> bank2 -> bank1`.
  3. `(0, 2) -> bank1 -> bank2`.
  4. `(0, 1) -> bank2 -> bank1`.
  5. `(2, 0) -> bank1 -> bank2`.
  6. `(1, 1) -> bank2 -> bank1`.
  7. `(2, 0) -> bank1 -> bank2`.
  8. `(0, 1) -> bank2 -> bank1`.
  9. `(0, 2) -> bank1 -> bank2`.
  10. `(0, 1) -> bank2 -> bank1`.
  11. `(0, 2) -> bank1 -> bank2`.

- **Set 2 Moves**:
  - Identical to Set 1 moves, executed independently.

---

### Verification:
- At each step, the constraints are satisfied:
  - The boat carries at most 2 people.
  - The boat never crosses empty.
  - Cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
- After 11 moves for each set, both sets reach the goal state: `(0, 0, bank2, 3, 3)`.

---

### Final Answer:
The plan involves executing the 11-step sequence for both Set 1 and Set 2 independently. After 11 moves for each set, all missionaries and cannibals from both sets are at `bank2`, and the boats are at `bank2`.
