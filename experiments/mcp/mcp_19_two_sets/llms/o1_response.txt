Thought about cannibals and missionaries problem for 1m 3s
Piecing together the puzzle

I'm analyzing the classic missionaries-and-cannibals problem, focusing on 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals per set, with a boat that can carry 2. Ensuring the boat never trips the outnumber rule when crossing.

Mapping parallel solutions

I'm gathering info on two distinct solutions for the missionaries-and-cannibals problem, each set operating independently. Emphasizing parallel strategies with separate boats once a valid plan emerges.

Clarifying the boat setup

I'm verifying whether there are two boats or just one, as the problem's articulation might imply dual boats but only mentions boat1. Each set's solution could differ based on the configuration.

Analyzing move sequences

I’m thinking through the 3M3C puzzle's 11 moves for each set, considering parallel solutions or sequences that avoid conflicts, as each set remains independent.

Evaluating approaches

I'm exploring whether the puzzle requires finding an explicit move list or aims for minimal steps for each set. Both parallel and individual solutions are acceptable, ensuring no boat conflicts.

Establishing the plan

I’m mapping out the standard 3M3C solution for each set, ensuring no conflicts or more cannibals than missionaries on the boat. This involves 22 moves total, repeated twice.

Mapping boat transitions

I’m detailing each boat transition to ensure every move is accounted for, noting potential sequential handling of sets due to the single boat constraint specified.

Formulating the plan

I’m outlining the standard solution to move all missionaries and cannibals to bank1 using boat1, ensuring no more cannibals than missionaries are on the boat at any given time.

Confirming the sequence

OK, let me see. The standard solution involves 11 crossings, ensuring no more cannibals than missionaries on the boat at any time. This approach maintains balance and progression.

Mapping the crossings

I’m detailing the journey of missionaries and cannibals using the standard 11 crossings, ensuring no more cannibals than missionaries on the boat at any time.

Confirming the final state

I'm verifying the final setup to ensure 3M3C end up on bank1 with the boat. Establishing this balance is key to meeting the constraints.

Validating the sequence

I'm carefully mapping the boat transitions, ensuring safety rules hold at each step. The sequence is verified to be precise and reliable.

Revisiting the strategy

I'm realizing that the sequence must avoid more cannibals than missionaries on the boat at once. Adjustments are necessary to ensure safety throughout the crossing.

Adjusting my approach

Ensuring safety constraints involve returning missionaries to maintain balance, avoiding more cannibals than missionaries on the boat or either bank. Adjustments are essential throughout.

Refining the sequence

I’m mapping the transitions to ensure no more cannibals than missionaries on the boat and both banks, adjusting the sequence for safety and accuracy.

Mapping the sequence

I’m working through the standard 3M3C solution step-by-step, ensuring no more cannibals than missionaries on the boat and both banks, while reaching the final state in 11 moves.

Verifying the sequence

I’m mapping out the standard 3M3C solution, covering 11 steps, to ensure no more cannibals than missionaries on the boat or banks at any given time.

Adjusting the plan

OK, let's ensure no more cannibals than missionaries on the boat at any point. This involves both sides being balanced at each step, using the standard 3M3C solution.

Revising the timing

I'm rethinking the steps to avoid outnumbering missionaries with cannibals on either side. Progress is noted by ensuring each side remains balanced throughout the sequence.

Adjusting my approach

Ensuring balance, I'm testing different sequences to avoid outnumbering costs and guarantee safety on both sides for each step. Progress is being made in crafting a viable plan.

Testing different tactics

I’m mapping out sequences to keep missionaries and cannibals balanced, avoiding outnumbering on both sides, and ensuring safety at each step. This process is refining the plan for better balance.

Testing various methods

I’m examining sequences to maintain balance between missionaries and cannibals, ensuring no outnumbering on either side, and enhancing the plan's progression for optimal safety.

Testing and adjusting

I'm thinking through sequences to maintain balance ensuring no outnumbering on either side, refining the plan for optimal safety and progression.

Ensuring balance

I'm mapping out transitions to maintain balance and avoid missionary or cannibal excesses on either side, refining the plan to ensure safety and progress with each step.

Taking a closer look

I’m ensuring that at each step, the boat never has more cannibals than missionaries when both are present. It's crucial to maintain a balanced method throughout the sequence.

Ensuring safe crossings

I’m mapping out each boat crossing, confirming no cannibals outnumber missionaries when both are on the boat. Safety is maintained throughout this checking process.

Mapping the strategy

I'm outlining a plan for two 3M3C sets, ensuring no more cannibals than missionaries, and examining possible configurations. Progress is being made in defining a clear approach.

Below is a completely worked‐out solution for the classic “3 missionaries and 3 cannibals” river‐crossing puzzle with the extra constraint that on the boat itself, cannibals may never outnumber missionaries (if any missionaries are on board). Then, since the problem says we have two separate copies (two “sets”) that do not interact, we simply apply the same 11‐crossing plan to each set independently.

Recap of the Rules
We have 3 missionaries (M) and 3 cannibals (C) on one bank (call it 
bank1
bank1).
A boat of capacity 2 is also on 
bank1
bank1.
We want all 3 missionaries and all 3 cannibals safely on the opposite bank (
bank2
bank2).
Constraint on each riverbank: Cannibals can never outnumber missionaries (if there are any missionaries present).
Constraint on the boat: Cannibals can never outnumber missionaries on the boat (if there is at least one missionary on board).
The boat cannot cross empty, and it carries at most 2 people.
The problem is doubled: We have two disjoint sets of “3M3C+boat” that do not affect each other. You can imagine them as happening on two separate rivers, each with its own boat.

Doing It Twice
Since the puzzle says we have two such sets that do not interact, you can simply:

​
 , and use “Boat2” for them.
Repeat exactly the same 11‐crossing strategy for that second set.
Each set is solved independently (they “don’t interact”), so you end up with two separate 11‐crossing sequences—one per set. In the end, for both sets:

All 6 missionaries and 6 cannibals (3+3 per set) wind up on 
bank2
bank2.
Each boat (Boat1 and Boat2) ends on 
bank2
bank2.
No side or boat was ever unsafe.
That completes a valid plan so that both copies of the “3M3C” problem are solved.
