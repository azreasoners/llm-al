Breaking down the problem

I’m working through the "Missionaries and Cannibals" puzzle, expanded to two cases. Each case is independent, so the goal is to find a sequence of moves to transport all people to the other side without breaking the rules.

Identifying key constraints

My approach involves tackling classic and enhanced versions of the missionaries and cannibals problem, ensuring no missionaries are eaten aboard the boat.

Taking a closer look

Now I'm analyzing the key elements: boat1 as the vessel, bank1 and bank2 as locations, missionaries and cannibals as groups, and integers for steps. The constraints ensure that cannibals never outnumber missionaries on board or at shore.

Formulating the strategy

I'm piecing together a plan to address both sets of missionaries and cannibals, considering their independence and the potential need for a dual-focused solution.

Breaking down the problem

I’m thinking through the classic problem of getting people across a river, which typically requires 11 trips. This suggests a structured sequence of actions to facilitate the solution efficiently.

Establishing game rules

I’m compiling the rules for the classic problem:

The boat accommodates two people.
The boat must stay occupied.
Cannibals should never outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
Charting progress

I’m developing a strategy to safely proceed through the missionaries and cannibals puzzle, ensuring the boat never transports more cannibals than missionaries.

Evaluating strategies

I’m curious if sending 1 missionary and 1 cannibal first works, then returning with the boat, keeping the counts balanced and safe. Progressing thoughtfully through each step.

Strategizing crossings

I’m thinking through the safest sequences of crossing using cannibals, ensuring missionaries are never outnumbered by cannibals on either side.

Evaluating safety

I’m checking the safety of missionries and cannibals on both banks. The left bank is safe with all, while the right bank, seemingly clear, needs careful consideration—sent one cannibal back.

Transferring the boat

I’m thinking through cannibals from left to right, ensuring safety on each bank. Then, with reduced numbers, I return the boat and repeat the process.

Analyzing the problem

Taking a closer look at the problem, I'm mapping out plans for each set and exploring the complexity it introduces with two sets and one boat. Progressing towards a clearer solution strategy.

Weighing the options

I'm thinking through the problem, where there are two separate sets of missionaries and cannibals. Interleaving steps isn't an option, so each set needs 11 steps, totaling 22 steps for the entire scenario.

Examining the boats' independence and river crossing rules, each set is treated separately, applying the plan twice.

Analyzing plan options

I'm examining whether to provide separate plans for each set or a uniform plan for both, as they don't interact. This involves considering their independence and potential benefits to both sets.

Formulating the solution

I’m outlining a plan to transport missionaries and cannibals from one bank to another using a boat, ensuring safe passage without being outnumbered on either side.

To solve this problem, we'll use the classic "Missionaries and Cannibals" solution for each set independently since they do not interact with each other. Below is a step-by-step plan that ensures all missionaries and cannibals from both sets safely cross from bank1 to bank2, adhering to all the given constraints.

Definitions:

Bank1: Starting bank.
Bank2: Destination bank.
Boat: Can carry a maximum of two people and cannot cross empty.
M: Missionary.
C: Cannibal.
Plan for Each Set (Apply this plan to both sets separately):

[Boat carries 1 M and 1 C from Bank1 to Bank2]

Bank1: 2M, 2C
Boat Position: Bank2
Bank2: 1M, 1C
Both banks are safe; cannibals do not outnumber missionaries.
[Boat carries 1 M back from Bank2 to Bank1]

Bank1: 3M, 2C
Boat Position: Bank1
Bank2: 0M, 1C
Both banks are safe.
[Boat carries 2 C from Bank1 to Bank2]

Bank1: 3M, 0C
Boat Position: Bank2
Bank2: 0M, 3C
Both banks are safe.
[Boat carries 1 C back from Bank2 to Bank1]

Bank1: 3M, 1C
Boat Position: Bank1
Bank2: 0M, 2C
Both banks are safe.
[Boat carries 2 M from Bank1 to Bank2]

Bank1: 1M, 1C
Boat Position: Bank2
Bank2: 2M, 2C
Both banks are safe.
[Boat carries 1 M and 1 C back from Bank2 to Bank1]

Bank1: 2M, 2C
Boat Position: Bank1
Bank2: 1M, 1C
Both banks are safe.
[Boat carries 2 M from Bank1 to Bank2]

Bank1: 0M, 2C
Boat Position: Bank2
Bank2: 3M, 1C
Both banks are safe.
[Boat carries 1 C back from Bank2 to Bank1]

Bank1: 0M, 3C
Boat Position: Bank1
Bank2: 3M, 0C
Both banks are safe.
[Boat carries 2 C from Bank1 to Bank2]

Bank1: 0M, 1C
Boat Position: Bank2
Bank2: 3M, 2C
Both banks are safe.
[Boat carries 1 C back from Bank2 to Bank1]

Bank1: 0M, 2C
Boat Position: Bank1
Bank2: 3M, 1C
Both banks are safe.
[Boat carries 2 C from Bank1 to Bank2]

Bank1: 0M, 0C
Boat Position: Bank2
Bank2: 3M, 3C
All have safely crossed to Bank2.
Explanation of the Plan:

Safety Checks: At each step, we ensure that cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
Boat Cannot Cross Empty: The boat always carries at least one person when crossing.
Independent Sets: Since the two sets do not interact, we apply this plan separately to each set.
Final Notes:

Total Trips per Set: 11 trips are required for each set.
Applying to Both Sets: Since the sets are independent, the total number of trips is 22, but the operations for each set are the same.
Efficiency: This is the minimal number of trips required under the given constraints.
By following this plan for both sets, all missionaries and cannibals from each set will safely reach bank2 without violating any of the specified rules.
