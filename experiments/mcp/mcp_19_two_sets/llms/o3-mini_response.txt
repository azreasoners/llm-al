There are five types of things: vessel, location, group, set, and integer.

Problem Description:
Consider the following. Three missionaries and three cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. On either side, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. The problem just described is doubled to have two separate occurrences at once, which don't interact with each other. That is, there are two sets, each with their respective set of three missionaries and three cannibals, a boat, and so on.

Instance:
boat1 is a vessel vessels. bank1 and bank2 are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

For each set, three missionaries and three cannibals are at location bank1, the boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2 for both sets.

Thought about missionaries and cannibals problem for 11 seconds
Mapping the scenario

OK, let me see. I’m addressing two parallel river crossing scenarios with missionaries and cannibals, a boat, and banks, ensuring the boat carries up to two people, and missionaries aren’t outnumbered by cannibals.

Piecing things together

I’m working on drawing up a detailed plan or algorithm to move all six missionaries and six cannibals across the river in both sets, ensuring safety and compliance with the rules.

Formulating the strategy

I’m charting a step-by-step plan, taking into account mission specifics and safety rules for two parallel puzzles, with the extra constraint that cannibals never outnumber missionaries on the boat.

I'm thinking it through

OK, let me see. I’m confirming the boat carries up to two people. The critical condition is ensuring missionaries never outnumber cannibals on the boat to prevent any harm.

Assessing safety guidelines

Ah, I’m considering that if no missionaries are on the boat, having two cannibals is safe, as the safety rule requires missionaries to outnumber cannibals when they’re present.

Charting the course

To avoid missionaries being eaten, the plan ensures missionaries always outnumber cannibals when they’re on the boat. If no missionaries are aboard, the boat can carry any number.

Navigating the sequence

I'm piecing together a sequence to transport two cannibals and one missionary at a time, ensuring safe crossings and adhering to constraints. This approach preserves the rule of cannibals never outnumbering missionaries on the boat.

Validating the sequence

I’m confirming the transportation sequence for missionaries and cannibals, ensuring their safe crossings. It’s interesting to see the intricacies of this classic puzzle unfold.

Ensuring smooth moves

I’m mapping out the sequence to ensure missionaries never outnumber cannibals on the boat. This confirms the boat’s safety and the puzzle’s integrity.

Crafting synchronized strategies

I’m working through a plan for two sets, blending moves to abide by the boat safety rule, ensuring all persons successfully reach bank2 while maintaining sequence integrity.

Below is one acceptable answer. In our answer we “label” the two independent problems as Set A and Set B. (Any names would do.) For each set the initial state is

Bank1: 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals, with the boat.
Bank2: 0 missionaries and 0 cannibals.
Recall that the boat carries at most two people and may not cross empty. In any location (or on the boat) if any missionaries are present then their number must be at least the number of cannibals. (When there are no missionaries there is no danger.)

One well‐known solution for the “3–3 Missionaries and Cannibals” problem is as follows. (Because the two sets do not interact, you may perform these moves for each set in parallel or interleave them arbitrarily.) We now describe a plan in which each “move” specifies the boat’s load and the direction of travel. (When a move “returns” one or two people, that is simply a move in the reverse direction.)

Plan for Each Set (Set A and Set B)
Move 1:
Load: 2 cannibals
Action: Boat carries 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
Resulting state:

Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 2:
Load: 1 cannibal
Action: Boat returns with 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Resulting state:

Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 3:
Load: 2 cannibals
Action: Boat carries 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
Resulting state:

Bank1: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Move 4:
Load: 1 cannibal
Action: Boat returns with 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Resulting state:

Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 5:
Load: 2 missionaries
Action: Boat carries 2 missionaries from bank1 to bank2.
Resulting state:

Bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 6:
Load: 1 missionary and 1 cannibal
Action: Boat returns with 1 missionary and 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Resulting state:

Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
Move 7:
Load: 2 missionaries
Action: Boat carries 2 missionaries from bank1 to bank2.
Resulting state:

Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 8:
Load: 1 cannibal
Action: Boat returns with 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Resulting state:

Bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Move 9:
Load: 2 cannibals
Action: Boat carries 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
Resulting state:

Bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 10:
Load: 1 cannibal
Action: Boat returns with 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Resulting state:

Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 11:
Load: 2 cannibals
Action: Boat carries 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
Final state:

Bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Comments and Verification
Safety on both banks and in the boat:
At every step, whenever missionaries are present at a bank the number of cannibals does not exceed the number of missionaries. (Also, note that on the boat the rule is applied only when missionaries are present; for example, moves with two cannibals are safe.)

Two independent puzzles:
Since Set A and Set B are independent (they have their own boat and groups), the above 11‐move plan is executed separately for each set. You may perform the moves for Set A and Set B concurrently, or interleave them arbitrarily, since there is no interaction between the two.

Final Answer
A valid plan is to have each set execute the following sequence of moves:

Boat takes 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
Boat returns with 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Boat takes 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
Boat returns with 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Boat takes 2 missionaries from bank1 to bank2.
Boat returns with 1 missionary and 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Boat takes 2 missionaries from bank1 to bank2.
Boat returns with 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Boat takes 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
Boat returns with 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Boat takes 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
After these moves, in both sets all 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals will be safely at bank2.

This is one acceptable solution to the doubled Missionaries and Cannibals problem.
