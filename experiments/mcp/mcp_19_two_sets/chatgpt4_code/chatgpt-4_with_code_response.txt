Result
[(3, 1, 3, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1), (0, 0, 0, 0)]
The solution to the problem involves the following steps for both sets simultaneously:

Move two cannibals from bank1 to bank2 (resulting in 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal at bank1, and 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals at bank2 for each set).
Move one missionary and one cannibal back from bank2 to bank1 (resulting in 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal at bank1, and 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals at bank2 for each set).
Move all remaining missionaries and cannibals from bank1 to bank2 (resulting in 0 missionaries and 0 cannibals at bank1, and 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals at bank2 for each set).
Each of these steps ensures that the number of cannibals never exceeds the number of missionaries on either bank at any time for both sets, thereby solving the problem. â€‹
