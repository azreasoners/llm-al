This is a variation of the classic "Missionaries and Cannibals" problem, with the added complexity of an island and specific constraints. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Entities**:
  - **Vessel**: boat (capacity = 2 people, cannot cross empty).
  - **Locations**: bank1 (starting point), island (intermediate point), bank2 (destination).
  - **Groups**: missionaries (M), cannibals (C).
  - **Integers**: 0 to 10 (used to count the number of missionaries and cannibals at each location or in the boat).

- **Initial State**:
  - bank1: 5 missionaries (M), 5 cannibals (C), boat.
  - island: 0 M, 0 C.
  - bank2: 0 M, 0 C.

- **Goal State**:
  - bank1: 0 M, 0 C.
  - island: 0 M, 0 C.
  - bank2: 5 M, 5 C, boat.

- **Constraints**:
  1. The boat can carry at most 2 people (M or C) at a time.
  2. The boat cannot cross the river or move to the island empty.
  3. At any location (bank1, island, bank2), the number of cannibals (C) must not exceed the number of missionaries (M), unless M = 0 (to prevent missionaries from being eaten).
  4. In the boat, the number of cannibals must not exceed the number of missionaries, unless M = 0.
  5. The boat can travel between bank1, island, and bank2.

- **State Representation**:
  - We represent the state as (M1, C1, M_island, C_island, M2, C2, boat_location), where:
    - M1, C1: Number of missionaries and cannibals on bank1.
    - M_island, C_island: Number of missionaries and cannibals on the island.
    - M2, C2: Number of missionaries and cannibals on bank2.
    - boat_location: Location of the boat (bank1, island, or bank2).

- **Initial State**: (5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, bank1).
- **Goal State**: (0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, bank2).

- **Valid Moves**:
  - The boat can move from bank1 to island, island to bank2, bank2 to island, or island to bank1, carrying 1 or 2 people (M or C).
  - The boat cannot move empty.
  - After each move, the constraints (no eating) must be satisfied at all locations and in the boat.

### Solution Strategy:
We need to find a sequence of valid moves that transfers all missionaries and cannibals from bank1 to bank2, using the island as an intermediate location if necessary. We'll use a step-by-step approach, ensuring that the constraints are satisfied at every step.

To simplify, we'll denote:
- Moves as (M, C, from_location → to_location), where M and C are the number of missionaries and cannibals in the boat.
- State as (M1, C1, M_island, C_island, M2, C2, boat_location).

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Initial State**: (5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, bank1).
   - Start by moving 2 cannibals from bank1 to the island.
   - Move: (0, 2, bank1 → island).
   - New State: (5, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, island).
     - Check: bank1 (5M, 3C → safe), island (0M, 2C → safe), bank2 (0M, 0C → safe).

2. **State**: (5, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, island).
   - Return 1 cannibal from the island to bank1.
   - Move: (0, 1, island → bank1).
   - New State: (5, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, bank1).
     - Check: bank1 (5M, 4C → safe), island (0M, 1C → safe), bank2 (0M, 0C → safe).

3. **State**: (5, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, bank1).
   - Move 2 missionaries from bank1 to the island.
   - Move: (2, 0, bank1 → island).
   - New State: (3, 4, 2, 1, 0, 0, island).
     - Check: bank1 (3M, 4C → safe), island (2M, 1C → safe), bank2 (0M, 0C → safe).

4. **State**: (3, 4, 2, 1, 0, 0, island).
   - Return 1 missionary from the island to bank1.
   - Move: (1, 0, island → bank1).
   - New State: (4, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, bank1).
     - Check: bank1 (4M, 4C → safe), island (1M, 1C → safe), bank2 (0M, 0C → safe).

5. **State**: (4, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, bank1).

   - New State: (2, 4, 3, 1, 0, 0, island).
     - Check: bank1 (2M, 4C → safe), island (3M, 1C → safe), bank2 (0M, 0C → safe).

6. **State**: (2, 4, 3, 1, 0, 0, island).
