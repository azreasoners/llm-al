Absolutely! This is a classic river crossing puzzle. Here's one possible solution to get all missionaries and cannibals safely across:

Plan:

Two cannibals cross from bank1 to the island. (Boat at island)
One cannibal returns from the island to bank1. (Boat at bank1)
Two missionaries cross from bank1 to the island. (Boat at island)
One missionary and one cannibal return from the island to bank1. (Boat at bank1)
Two missionaries cross from bank1 to the island. (Boat at island)
One cannibal returns from the island to bank1. (Boat at bank1)
Two cannibals cross from bank1 to the island. (Boat at island)
One cannibal returns from the island to bank1. (Boat at bank1)
Two cannibals cross from bank1 to the island. (Boat at island)
One cannibal returns from the island to bank1. (Boat at bank1)
Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2. (Boat at bank2)
One cannibal returns from bank2 to the island. (Boat at island)
Two cannibals cross from the island to bank2. (Boat at bank2)
One cannibal returns from bank2 to the island. (Boat at island)
Two cannibals cross from the island to bank2. (Boat at bank2)
Now all cannibals are on bank2. The remaining steps are straightforward:

Two missionaries cross from the island to bank2. (Boat at bank2)
One missionary returns from bank2 to the island. (Boat at island)
Two missionaries cross from the island to bank2. (Boat at bank2)
Success! All missionaries and cannibals are safely on bank2.

Key Points:

Safety: The plan never leaves missionaries outnumbered at any location (either bank or the island).
Island: The island is crucial, providing a temporary holding place to prevent unsafe ratios on either bank.
Efficiency: While there might be other solutions, this plan minimizes unnecessary back-and-forth trips.
