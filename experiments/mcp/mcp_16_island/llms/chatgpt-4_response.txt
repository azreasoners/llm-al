The problem of the missionaries and cannibals crossing the river, including an island, involves careful planning to ensure that missionaries are not outnumbered by cannibals at any location or in the boat during the crossing. Given the additional location of the island, the problem is a bit more complex but still follows similar rules to ensure no group of missionaries gets outnumbered.

Here's a potential solution plan:

Step-by-step Plan
Start: All five missionaries (M) and five cannibals (C) are at Bank1, and the boat is also at Bank1.
Move 1: Two cannibals cross from Bank1 to the Island. (Bank1: 5M, 3C; Island: 2C; Bank2: 0M, 0C)
Move 2: One cannibal returns from the Island to Bank1. (Bank1: 5M, 4C; Island: 1C; Bank2: 0M, 0C)
Move 3: Two missionaries cross from Bank1 to the Island. (Bank1: 3M, 4C; Island: 1C, 2M; Bank2: 0M, 0C)
Move 4: One cannibal and one missionary return from the Island to Bank1. (Bank1: 4M, 5C; Island: 0C, 1M; Bank2: 0M, 0C)
Move 5: Two cannibals cross from Bank1 to the Island. (Bank1: 4M, 3C; Island: 2C, 1M; Bank2: 0M, 0C)
Move 6: Two cannibals cross from the Island to Bank2. (Bank1: 4M, 3C; Island: 0C, 1M; Bank2: 0M, 2C)
Move 7: One cannibal returns from Bank2 to the Island. (Bank1: 4M, 3C; Island: 1C, 1M; Bank2: 0M, 1C)
Move 8: Two missionaries cross from Bank1 to the Island. (Bank1: 2M, 3C; Island: 1C, 3M; Bank2: 0M, 1C)
Move 9: One missionary and one cannibal return from the Island to Bank1. (Bank1: 3M, 4C; Island: 0C, 2M; Bank2: 0M, 1C)
Move 10: Two cannibals cross from Bank1 to the Island. (Bank1: 3M, 2C; Island: 2C, 2M; Bank2: 0M, 1C)
Move 11: Two cannibals cross from the Island to Bank2. (Bank1: 3M, 2C; Island: 0C, 2M; Bank2: 0M, 3C)
Move 12: One cannibal returns from Bank2 to the Island. (Bank1: 3M, 2C; Island: 1C, 2M; Bank2: 0M, 2C)
Move 13: Two missionaries cross from Bank1 to the Island. (Bank1: 1M, 2C; Island: 1C, 4M; Bank2: 0M, 2C)
Move 14: One missionary and one cannibal return from the Island to Bank1. (Bank1: 2M, 3C; Island: 0C, 3M; Bank2: 0M, 2C)
Move 15: Two missionaries cross from Bank1 to Bank2. (Bank1: 0M, 3C; Island: 0C, 3M; Bank2: 2M, 2C)
Move 16: One missionary returns from Bank2 to the Island. (Bank1: 0M, 3C; Island: 1M, 3M; Bank2: 1M, 2C)
Move 17: Three missionaries cross from the Island to Bank2. (Bank1: 0M, 3C; Island: 0C, 0M; Bank2: 4M, 2C)
Move 18: Two cannibals cross from Bank1 to the Island. (Bank1: 0M, 1C; Island: 2C, 0M; Bank2: 4M, 2C)
Move 19: Two cannibals cross from the Island to Bank2. (Bank1: 0M, 1C; Island: 0C, 0M; Bank2: 4M, 4C)
Move 20: Last cannibal crosses from Bank1 to Bank2. (Bank1: 0M, 0C; Island: 0C, 0M; Bank2: 5M, 5C)
Conclusion
All five missionaries and all five cannibals successfully cross to Bank2 without any group being outnumbered at any location or in the boat during crossings.
