Thought about missionaries and cannibals crossing for 56 seconds
Mapping out scenario constraints

We’re tackling a "missionaries and cannibals" puzzle with a boat and an island. The boat, holding just one passenger, prevents cannibals from outnumbering missionaries.

Navigating intermediate solutions

I'm thinking through how the island can help balance the boat. The goal is to avoid unsafe configurations on banks, ensuring the boat's setup remains secure throughout the crossing.

Formulating the strategy

I’m piecing together moves to maintain balance. Moving two cannibals to the island and then bringing one back keeps the boat safe while avoiding unsafe configurations on the banks.

Piecing together safe moves

I’m examining feasible steps, ensuring no unsafe configurations. Consideration of boat and island states is key to finding a balanced, viable solution. Progress is being made.

Shifting progress

Moving missionaries and cannibals involves careful coordination to avoid unsafe patterns. I’m piecing together steps to ensure the boat and islands are balanced and safe throughout.

Evaluating move safety

I'm closely examining alternate steps to balance missionaries and cannibals on the islands, ensuring no unsafe pairings occur based on the constraints. Progress is constant and methodical.

Crafting a new plan

I’m digging into using the island as an intermediate stop for cannibals, then missionaries, to ensure the final crossing to bank2 is safe and balanced. This approach feels promising.

Refining the strategy

I'm considering moving cannibals to bank2 first, ensuring the boat can always return to bank1 empty. This method involves carefully balancing the constraints for optimal results.

Pondering new strategies

Wondering about using the island as a makeshift storage for cannibals, allowing controlled movement to bank2, while ensuring bank1 remains predominantly missionaries.

Organizing the sequence

I’m detailing the variables to be optimized, establishing base cases and transformations, and determining dependencies to ensure a systematic progression.

Strategizing transfer

I'm finalizing the sequence to transport missionaries and cannibals, ensuring the boat's return to bank2 is premature. This approach allows for a balanced and safe progression.

Ensuring vehicle safety

I'm figuring out a way to shuttle missionaries subtly, making sure they don't disrupt the balance during transport. This approach seems poised for a balanced distribution.

Mapping transitions

I’m outlining the optimal transfer sequence for missionaries and cannibals, maintaining safety by ensuring cannibals never outnumber missionaries at any location. Using the island as an intermediate can assist.

Ensuring safety

I’m noting initial moves with 2 cannibals to bank2, ensuring bank1's safety. Carefully detailing each transfer, I maintain a balanced state and control cannibals' presence throughout.

Ensuring safety

I'm meticulously crafting the transfer sequence, ensuring cannibals never outnumber missionaries. Each transfer is checked for a balanced state, guiding the steps to a well-balanced solution.

Ensuring safety

Let me see. I’m meticulously avoiding unsafe conditions by avoiding scenarios where cannibals could outnumber missionaries. Each step is carefully examined to uphold a balanced and secure state.

Redirecting strategy

Using the island to adjust numbers and enable safe transfers seems efficient. Transferring cannibals to the island first, moving missionaries to bank2, and then ferrying cannibals to bank2 optimizes balance.

Mapping transfer steps

OK, I’m considering transferring cannibals to the island and missionaries to bank2, ensuring safety. Using a 2-seat boat, each movement is carefully planned to maintain balance.

Crafting the transfer process

I’m figuring out how to safely move missionaries to bank2. Each mission is two by two, carefully planning the boat's return to keep bank1 safe.

Crafting transfer options

Balancing bank1's safety with island use and returning a missionary creates a scenario with 4 cannibals and 3 missionaries, ensuring no bank safety issues.

Balancing bank1

Moving 2 cannibals to the island leaves bank1 with equal numbers of missionaries and cannibals, ensuring a safe transfer to bank2.

Ensuring balanced transitions

OK, let me see. The plan involves bringing the boat back from bank2, moving it between banks to maintain a balanced transfer of missionaries and cannibals while keeping bank1 safe.

Shifting balance

OK, I’m outlining how to move missionaries while keeping the balance steady. The aim is to ensure bank1's safety throughout the transfer.

Balancing missionaries

Thinking through the issue of balancing missionaries on bank1 while keeping bank2 safe, I'm ensuring seamless boat trips and limiting dangerous scenarios to stabilize the transfer process.

We will show that it is possible to get all five missionaries and five cannibals safely from bank1 to bank2 using a boat that holds at most two people and that may visit an “island” as well as the two banks. (Any answer which gives a complete sequence of “moves” that never leaves a location in a “dangerous” state is acceptable.)

In what follows a “move” is written in the form

  (m,c): Origin → Destination

meaning that m missionaries and c cannibals ride the boat from the “Origin” location to the “Destination” location. (Remember that the boat cannot cross empty, and in any location (or on the boat) if there is at least one missionary then the number of missionaries must be at least the number of cannibals.)

We label the three locations as follows:

bank1: the starting bank
island: the island the boat may visit
bank2: the destination bank
At any time we may describe the “state” by giving the number of missionaries and cannibals at bank1, on the island, and at bank2. (Note that if a location has no missionaries the “cannibals–outnumber–missionaries” rule does not apply there.)

One acceptable solution was to perform the following 21 moves. (You may verify that after each move every location is “safe” and that the final state is bank1 = (0,0), island = (0,0), bank2 = (5,5).)

Solution (21 moves):

1. (0,2): bank1 → island
  After: bank1 has (5,3); island (0,2); bank2 (0,0).

2. (0,1): island → bank1
  After: bank1 (5,4); island (0,1); bank2 (0,0).

3. (0,2): bank1 → island
  After: bank1 (5,2); island (0,3); bank2 (0,0).

4. (0,1): island → bank1
  After: bank1 (5,3); island (0,2); bank2 (0,0).

  (At this point the cannibals are being “peeled off” from bank1. Note that bank1 always has at least as many missionaries as cannibals, so no one is in danger.)

5. (2,0): bank1 → bank2
  After: bank1 (3,3); bank2 (2,0); island (0,2).

6. (1,0): bank2 → bank1
  After: bank1 (4,3); bank2 (1,0); island (0,2).

7. (0,2): bank1 → island
  After: bank1 (4,1); island (0,4); bank2 (1,0).

8. (0,1): island → bank2
  After: bank1 (4,1); island (0,3); bank2 (1,1).

9. (2,0): bank1 → bank2
  After: bank1 (2,1); bank2 (3,1); island (0,3).

10. (0,1): bank2 → bank1
  After: bank1 (2,2); bank2 (3,0); island (0,3).

11. (0,2): bank1 → island
  After: bank1 (2,0); island (0,5); bank2 (3,0).

12. (0,1): island → bank2
  After: bank1 (2,0); island (0,4); bank2 (3,1).

13. (0,2): island → bank2
  After: bank1 (2,0); island (0,2); bank2 (3,3).

14. (0,1): bank2 → bank1
  After: bank1 (2,1); island (0,2); bank2 (3,2).

15. (2,0): bank1 → bank2
  After: bank1 (0,1); island (0,2); bank2 (5,2).

16. (0,1): bank2 → bank1
  After: bank1 (0,2); island (0,2); bank2 (5,1).

  (Now all the missionaries are already on bank2 except for those “trapped” with extra cannibals on bank1; and bank1, having no missionaries, is “safe” no matter how many cannibals are there.)

17. (0,2): bank1 → bank2
  After: bank1 (0,0); island (0,2); bank2 (5,3).

18. (0,1): bank2 → island
  After: bank1 (0,0); island (0,3); bank2 (5,2).

19. (0,2): island → bank2
  After: bank1 (0,0); island (0,1); bank2 (5,4).

20. (0,1): bank2 → island
  After: bank1 (0,0); island (0,2); bank2 (5,3).

21. (0,2): island → bank2
  After: bank1 (0,0); island (0,0); bank2 (5,5).

At the end all five missionaries and five cannibals are safely at bank2 and at no point was a location left with missionaries outnumbered by cannibals (nor was the boat ever left with a dangerous mix).

Final Comments
Any complete plan that gives a legal sequence of moves (i.e. one in which at every step every location with any missionaries has at least as many missionaries as cannibals, and no crossing is done with an empty boat) is a correct answer. The answer above is one acceptable solution.
