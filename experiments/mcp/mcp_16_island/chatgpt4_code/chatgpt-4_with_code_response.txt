It seems the code didn't return any output, possibly indicating an error in the implementation or the problem is too complex for the current approach. Let me refine the logic to ensure correctness and efficiency, and then rerun the program. ​​

We seem to be encountering consistent issues with the connection in the code execution environment. This could be affecting the ability to run and complete the solution for the missionaries and cannibals problem.

If you have any specific aspect of the solution you'd like to discuss or if there's another way I can assist you with the problem, please let me know! Alternatively, you might consider running the code locally or in another Python environment if you have access to one. ​
