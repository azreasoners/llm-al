Use the code interpreter to generate a Python program to solve the following problem. Revise the program as many times as needed until the program is correct.

There are four types of things: vessel, location, group, and integer.

Problem Description:
Five missionaries and five cannibals shall cross a river in a boat which carries at most two people at once. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. At any location, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries or the missionaries will be eaten. Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten. The boat's capacity is 2. Additionally, there is an island also which the boat can go to.

boat is a vessel. bank1, bank2, and island are locations. missionaries and cannibals are groups. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are integers.

Five missionaries and five cannibals are at location bank1. The boat is at location bank1. Find a plan so that all missionaries and all cannibals are at location bank2.
