This problem is a classic example of a state-space search problem. Each state describes the configuration of the missionaries, cannibals, boat, and oars at either bank1 or bank2. The solution involves finding a sequence of valid transitions (boat crossings) that satisfies the constraints.

Here's how we can formalize and solve the problem:

State Representation
Each state is represented as a tuple:
(
𝑚
1
,
𝑐
1
,
𝑏
,
𝑜
1
)
(m1,c1,b,o1), where:

𝑚
1
m1: Number of missionaries at bank1.
𝑐
1
c1: Number of cannibals at bank1.
𝑏
b: Boat location (0 for bank1, 1 for bank2).
𝑜
1
o1: Number of oars at bank1.
The state implicitly provides:

𝑚
2
=
3
−
𝑚
1
m2=3−m1: Number of missionaries at bank2.
𝑐
2
=
3
−
𝑐
1
c2=3−c1: Number of cannibals at bank2.
𝑜
2
=
2
−
𝑜
1
o2=2−o1: Number of oars at bank2.
Initial State
(
3
,
3
,
0
,
2
)
(3,3,0,2):
All missionaries, cannibals, boat, and oars are at bank1.

Goal State
(
0
,
0
,
1
,
0
)
(0,0,1,0):
All missionaries, cannibals, boat, and oars are at bank2.

Transition Rules
A valid move involves taking 1 or 2 people from the current boat location to the other bank, with these constraints:

The boat cannot cross without at least one person.
At least one oar must be at the boat's current location:
1 oar for a single-person crossing.
2 oars for a two-person crossing.
The number of cannibals can never outnumber the missionaries at any location (bank1, boat, or bank2), unless there are no missionaries at that location.
Solution Approach
We can solve this using breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all possible sequences of moves, ensuring we find the shortest solution. Each state transition is checked for validity against the above constraints.

I will write the algorithm to find the solution.

It seems there was an issue with displaying the solution. Let me analyze and refine the result to present it correctly. ​​

'No solution found.'
It seems there is no valid solution found based on the defined constraints and rules. This could indicate a need to adjust the transition logic or revisit the constraints for valid moves. If you'd like, I can debug and refine the solution further. ​
