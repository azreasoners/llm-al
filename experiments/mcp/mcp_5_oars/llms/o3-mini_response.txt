Thought about missionaries and cannibals puzzle for 17 seconds
Navigating constraints

I'm working through the puzzle's rules: ensuring cannibals never outnumber missionaries on the boat or the shore, and that the boat, with a 2-person capacity, can't cross empty.

Formulating the sequence

I'm charting the sequence of moves, ensuring cannibals never outnumber missionaries on the boat or shore, and factoring in the oars' requirement for both the boat's departure and return.

Crafting the solution

Piecing together constraints: boat rules, oars needed for crossings, and ensuring missionaries outnumber cannibals on any side or the boat.

Clarifying the oar situation

OK, let me see. If the boat carries two people, it uses both oars, leaving one bank short. However, each bank always has a spare oar available.

Tracing oar movement

I'm thinking the boat carries both oars on crossings, leaving one bank temporarily short until they return. This highlights the need to carefully track oar positions.

Tracking oar movements

OK, let me see. Each bank starts with one oar. The boat uses an oar from its current bank, temporarily leaving it short until the oar returns.

Tracking oar shifts

It's interesting to see that even with boat movements, each bank consistently retains one oar. This ensures a stable supply of oars at all times, maintaining a reliable balance.

Piecing it together

Assuming oars stay fixed to banks, the boat needs both oars if two people row together. This keeps the missionary-to-cannibal ratio balanced throughout the trip.

Balancing numbers

It's key that cannibals never outnumber missionaries on the boat. If the numbers align, the journey can continue efficiently and safely.

Navigating crossings

OK, let me see. The plan involves sending two cannibals first, then alternating between sending one cannibal back and forth until missionaries and cannibals are safely ashore.

Verifying the strategy

I’m working through the classic 11-move method, making sure no missionaries or cannibals are left alone in outnumbered scenarios.

Taking a closer look

I’m digging into the classic 11-move method again, ensuring all moves keep the boat safe with missionaries and cannibals, avoiding any risky outnumbered situations.

Confirming the solution

OK, let me see. The detailed classic method for moving cannibals and missionaries involves 11 steps, ensuring the boat's safety by keeping the number of cannibals lower than the missionaries.

Breaking down the strategy

OK, let's think it through: the classic 11-move method ensures safe transport. The boat always keeps the number of cannibals lower than the missionaries, avoiding risky situations.

Moving the boat

I’m ensuring all moves are safe: updating the boat's inventory on both banks to prevent outnumbered scenarios for missionaries and cannibals. Each move keeps everything balanced and secure.

We will show one solution in which each “move” is a single crossing of the river by the boat. In our notation the state is described by how many missionaries (M) and cannibals (C) are on each bank and where the boat is. (Recall that a bank with no missionaries is “safe” even if cannibals are present, and on any “group” the cannibals must never strictly outnumber the missionaries when at least one missionary is present.) Also note that when the boat carries two people it requires two oars (one per person), and when it carries one person it needs only one oar—but at no time may the boat cross empty. In addition, we must be careful that the people in the boat never form a situation in which cannibals outnumber missionaries (if any missionary is present on board).

The classical “missionaries and cannibals” problem has a well‐known solution. One acceptable plan is to number the moves as follows. (For clarity, “bank1” is the starting bank and “bank2” is the destination.)

Initial Situation
Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Boat: at bank1
Remember: The oar–constraint is built in so that if one person crosses (using one oar) or two people cross (using both oars) the boat can make the trip provided that on the boat the cannibals do not outnumber the missionaries.

The Moves
Move 1: Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2 in the boat.

Boat’s load: (0M, 2C) → safe (no missionaries on board)
After move:
Bank1: 3M, 1C
Bank2: 0M, 2C
Boat: at bank2
Move 2: One cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1.

Boat’s load: (0M, 1C) → safe
After move:
Bank1: 3M, 2C
Bank2: 0M, 1C
Boat: at bank1
Move 3: Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.

Boat’s load: (0M, 2C) → safe
After move:
Bank1: 3M, 0C
Bank2: 0M, 3C
Boat: at bank2
Move 4: One cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1.

Boat’s load: (0M, 1C) → safe
After move:
Bank1: 3M, 1C
Bank2: 0M, 2C
Boat: at bank1
Move 5: Two missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2.

Boat’s load: (2M, 0C) → safe
After move:
Bank1: 1M, 1C
Bank2: 2M, 2C
Boat: at bank2
(Both banks remain safe: at bank1, the single missionary is not outnumbered; at bank2, 2M are not outnumbered by 2C.)
Move 6: One missionary and one cannibal return from bank2 to bank1.

Boat’s load: (1M, 1C) → safe (numbers equal)
After move:
Bank1: 2M, 2C
Bank2: 1M, 1C
Boat: at bank1
Move 7: Two missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2.

Boat’s load: (2M, 0C) → safe
After move:
Bank1: 0M, 2C
Bank2: 3M, 1C
Boat: at bank2
(Bank1 is safe because there are no missionaries to be endangered.)
Move 8: One cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1.

Boat’s load: (0M, 1C) → safe
After move:
Bank1: 0M, 3C
Bank2: 3M, 0C
Boat: at bank1
Move 9: Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.

Boat’s load: (0M, 2C) → safe
After move:
Bank1: 0M, 1C
Bank2: 3M, 2C
Boat: at bank2
Move 10: One cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1.

Boat’s load: (0M, 1C) → safe
After move:
Bank1: 0M, 2C
Bank2: 3M, 1C
Boat: at bank1
Move 11: Two cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.

Boat’s load: (0M, 2C) → safe
After move:
Bank1: 0M, 0C
Bank2: 3M, 3C
Boat: at bank2
Verification of All Conditions
On both banks: At every stage where missionaries are present, they are not outnumbered by cannibals.
On the boat: Every crossing is done so that if there is a missionary present on board, cannibals do not outnumber him/her.
Boat Capacity & Oars: Every crossing respects the boat’s capacity (at most two people) and the “oar–rule” (a single rower is enough for a one‐person trip, two people require two oars, and the boat never travels empty).
Conclusion
At the end of Move 11, all 3 missionaries and all 3 cannibals have safely moved from bank1 to bank2 without violating any of the constraints. This step‐by‐step plan is a valid solution to the puzzle.
