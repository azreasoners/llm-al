Here's a solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, along with an explanation of how it relates to your defined types:

Understanding the Constraints

Boat Capacity: The boat can hold a maximum of two people.
Safety: Cannibals can never outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
Solution (Steps)

Let's use M to represent missionaries and C for cannibals. The notation (M, C) will represent the number of missionaries and cannibals on a given bank.

(Bank 1: 3M, 3C; Boat: Empty; Bank 2: Empty)

Two cannibals cross the river.
(Bank 1: 3M, 1C; Boat: 0M, 2C; Bank 2: 0M, 2C)
(Bank 1: 3M, 1C; Boat: 0M, 2C; Bank 2: 0M, 2C)

One cannibal returns.
(Bank 1: 3M, 2C; Boat: 0M, 1C; Bank 2: 0M, 1C)
(Bank 1: 3M, 2C; Boat: 0M, 1C; Bank 2: 0M, 1C)

Two missionaries cross the river.
(Bank 1: 1M, 2C; Boat: 2M, 1C; Bank 2: 0M, 1C)
(Bank 1: 1M, 2C; Boat: 2M, 1C; Bank 2: 0M, 1C)

One missionary returns.
(Bank 1: 2M, 2C; Boat: 1M, 1C; Bank 2: 0M, 1C)
(Bank 1: 2M, 2C; Boat: 1M, 1C; Bank 2: 0M, 1C)

Two cannibals cross the river.
(Bank 1: 2M, 0C; Boat: 1M, 2C; Bank 2: 0M, 3C)
(Bank 1: 2M, 0C; Boat: 1M, 2C; Bank 2: 0M, 3C)

One cannibal returns.
(Bank 1: 2M, 1C; Boat: 1M, 1C; Bank 2: 0M, 2C)
(Bank 1: 2M, 1C; Boat: 1M, 1C; Bank 2: 0M, 2C)

Two missionaries cross the river.
(Bank 1: 0M, 1C; Boat: 3M, 1C; Bank 2: 0M, 2C)
(Bank 1: 0M, 1C; Boat: 3M, 1C; Bank 2: 0M, 2C)

One cannibal returns.
(Bank 1: 0M, 2C; Boat: 3M, 0C; Bank 2: 0M, 1C)
(Bank 1: 0M, 2C; Boat: 3M, 0C; Bank 2: 0M, 1C)

Two cannibals cross the river.
(Bank 1: 0M, 0C; Boat: 3M, 2C; Bank 2: 0M, 3C)
(Bank 1: 0M, 0C; Boat: 3M, 2C; Bank 2: 0M, 3C)

One missionary returns.
(Bank 1: 1M, 0C; Boat: 2M, 2C; Bank 2: 0M, 3C)
(Bank 1: 1M, 0C; Boat: 2M, 2C; Bank 2: 0M, 3C)

Two missionaries cross the river.
(Bank 1: 0M, 0C; Boat: 3M, 2C; Bank 2: 0M, 3C)
(Bank 1: 0M, 0C; Boat: 3M, 2C; Bank 2: 0M, 3C)

One cannibal returns.
(Bank 1: 0M, 1C; Boat: 3M, 1C; Bank 2: 0M, 2C)
(Bank 1: 0M, 1C; Boat: 3M, 1C; Bank 2: 0M, 2C)

Two cannibals cross the river.
(Bank 1: 0M, 0C; Boat: 3M, 3C; Bank 2: 0M, 3C)
Relating to Your Types

vessel (boat): The boat is the vessel that transports people between locations.
location (bank1, bank2): The riverbanks are the locations where the missionaries and cannibals are situated.
group (missionaries, cannibals): The missionaries and cannibals are the groups being transported.
integer (0, 1, 2, 3): These integers represent the number of missionaries and cannibals in each location or the boat.
The problem is a classic example of a state-space search problem. Each step represents a transition from one state (distribution of missionaries and cannibals) to another. The goal is to find a sequence of valid transitions that leads to the desired final state (all missionaries and cannibals on the opposite bank). The hat exchange part is an added element that does not affect the solution as it does not affect the number of missionaries and cannibals in any location.
