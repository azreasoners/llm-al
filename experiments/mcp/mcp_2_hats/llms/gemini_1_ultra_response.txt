Absolutely! Here's a breakdown of the classic Missionaries and Cannibals Problem, along with a step-by-step solution.

Understanding the Rules

Boat Capacity: The boat can carry a maximum of two people.
Cannibal Constraint: At no point can cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank of the river or while on the boat. This is to prevent culinary mishaps.
Hat Swap: We can add a bit of fun with missionaries and cannibals exchanging hats, but this doesn't affect the core logic of the solution.
Representing the Problem with State

We can represent the current state of the puzzle with the following:

M1: Number of Missionaries on bank1
C1: Number of Cannibals on bank1
M2: Number of Missionaries on bank2
C2: Number of Cannibals on bank2
B: Location of the boat ("bank1" or "bank2")
Initial State:

M1 = 3
C1 = 3
M2 = 0
C2 = 0
B = bank1
Goal State:

M1 = 0
C1 = 0
M2 = 3
C2 = 3
B = bank2
Solution

Here's a step-by-step solution to get everyone safely across the river:

Two cannibals cross to bank2:
M1 = 3, C1 = 1, M2 = 0, C2 = 2, B = bank2
One cannibal returns to bank1:
M1 = 3, C1 = 2, M2 = 0, C2 = 1, B = bank1
Two missionaries cross to bank2:
M1 = 1, C1 = 2, M2 = 2, C2 = 1, B = bank2
One missionary and one cannibal return to bank1:
M1 = 2, C1 = 3, M2 = 1, C2 = 0, B = bank1
Two cannibals cross to bank2:
M1 = 2, C1 = 1, M2 = 1, C2 = 2, B = bank2
One cannibal returns to bank1:
M1 = 2, C1 = 2, M2 = 1, C2 = 1, B = bank1
Two missionaries cross to bank2:
M1 = 0, C1 = 2, M2 = 3, C2 = 1, B = bank2
One cannibal returns to bank1:
M1 = 0, C1 = 3, M2 = 3, C2 = 0, B = bank1
Two cannibals cross to bank2:
M1 = 0, C1 = 1, M2 = 3, C2 = 2, B = bank2
One cannibal returns to bank1:
M1 = 0, C1 = 2, M2 = 3, C2 = 1, B = bank1
Two cannibals cross to bank2 (Success!)
M1 = 0, C1 = 0, M2 = 3, C2 = 3, B = bank2
Feel free to experiment with different variations of this problem for even trickier challenges!
