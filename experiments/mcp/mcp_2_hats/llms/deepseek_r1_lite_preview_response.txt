Alright, so I have this problem about missionaries and cannibals trying to cross a river. There are three missionaries and three cannibals on one side of the river, and they need to get all of them to the other side using a boat that can carry at most two people at a time. The boat can't cross the river empty, and there are some rules about how many missionaries and cannibals can be on each side of the river at any given time.

First, I need to understand the rules clearly. The boat can carry up to two people, and it can't go across the river without anyone in it. Also, on either side of the river, the cannibals should never outnumber the missionaries, or else the missionaries will be eaten. Additionally, on the boat itself, cannibals shouldn't outnumber missionaries, or the missionaries will be eaten there.

Okay, so starting point: all three missionaries and three cannibals are on bank1, and the boat is also on bank1. The goal is to get everyone to bank2 without breaking any of these rules.

I think the best way to approach this is to consider the possible moves step by step, keeping track of how many missionaries and cannibals are on each bank and in the boat at each step.

Let's denote the number of missionaries and cannibals on bank1 and bank2. So initially, bank1 has 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals, and bank2 has 0 of each. The boat is on bank1.

I need to make sure that after each move, the number of cannibals doesn't exceed the number of missionaries on either bank or in the boat.

Maybe I can list out possible moves:

1. Two missionaries go from bank1 to bank2.

2. One missionary and one cannibal go from bank1 to bank2.

3. Two cannibals go from bank1 to bank2.

4. One missionary goes from bank1 to bank2.

5. One cannibal goes from bank1 to bank2.

But wait, the boat can carry up to two people, so moves involving only one person are allowed, but the boat can't go empty.

I need to see which of these moves are safe, meaning they don't leave a situation where cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat.

Let's consider the first move: two missionaries go from bank1 to bank2.

After this move:

- bank1: 1 missionary, 3 cannibals

- bank2: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- boat: on bank2

Is this safe? On bank1, 1 missionary and 3 cannibals – cannibals outnumber missionaries, which is bad because missionaries could be eaten. So this move is not allowed.

Next, one missionary and one cannibal go from bank1 to bank2.

After this move:

- bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- boat: on bank2

Is this safe? On bank1, 2 missionaries and 2 cannibals – cannibals do not outnumber missionaries. On bank2, 1 missionary and 1 cannibal – also safe. In the boat, 1 missionary and 1 cannibal – safe. So this seems okay.

Let's consider two cannibals going from bank1 to bank2.

After this move:

- bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- boat: on bank2

Is this safe? On bank1, 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal – safe. On bank2, 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals – cannibals outnumber missionaries, but since there are no missionaries there, does that matter? Wait, the rule says cannibals may never outnumber missionaries on either side. If there are no missionaries, having cannibals is probably not allowed because there would be no missionaries to prevent them from doing something. So maybe this is not allowed.

Let's check the rules again. It says cannibals may never outnumber missionaries on either side or on the boat. If there are no missionaries on bank2, having cannibals there might be problematic because there are no missionaries to prevent them from eating any that might be there, but since there are none, maybe it's okay. However, to be safe, I'll assume that having cannibals without any missionaries is not allowed.

So, perhaps two cannibals moving together is not a safe move.

Next, one missionary goes alone.

After this move:

- bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- boat: on bank2

On bank1, 2 missionaries and 3 cannibals – cannibals outnumber missionaries, which is bad. So this move is not allowed.

Similarly, one cannibal going alone.

After this move:

- bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- boat: on bank2

On bank1, 3 missionaries and 2 cannibals – safe. On bank2, 0 missionaries and 1 cannibal – same issue as before. Probably not allowed.

So, based on this, the only safe initial move is one missionary and one cannibal going from bank1 to bank2.

Let's proceed with that.

So, move 1:

- One missionary and one cannibal go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- boat: on bank2

Now, from bank2, someone needs to go back to bank1 to bring the boat back. Otherwise, no one can go further.

Who should go back? It should be someone who will not leave an unsafe situation.

If one person goes back, it could be a missionary or a cannibal.

Let's consider different options.

Option A: One cannibal goes back to bank1.

After this:

- bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- boat: on bank1

On bank1, 2 missionaries and 3 cannibals – cannibals outnumber missionaries, which is bad.

Option B: One missionary goes back to bank1.

After this:

- bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- boat: on bank1

On bank1, 3 missionaries and 2 cannibals – safe. On bank2, 0 missionaries and 1 cannibal – same issue as before.

So, both options lead to an unsafe situation on one of the banks.

Wait, is there another option? Maybe two people go back to bank1.

But the boat can only carry up to two people, and currently, on bank2, there is 1 missionary and 1 cannibal.

If two people go back, but bank2 only has one person, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe only one person goes back, but both options seem to lead to an unsafe situation.

Is there a different initial move that I can consider?

Let's reconsider the first move.

Maybe instead of one missionary and one cannibal going first, I should try two cannibals going first, even though it seems unsafe.

Let me see.

Move 1: Two cannibals go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- boat: on bank2

As discussed earlier, on bank1, 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal – safe. On bank2, 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals – potentially unsafe.

If I proceed, someone needs to go back.

Option A: One cannibal goes back.

- bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- boat: on bank1

On bank1, 3 and 2 – safe. On bank2, 0 and 1 – same issue.

Option B: Two cannibals go back, but there's only one on bank2, so not possible.

This doesn't seem to help.

Another option: perhaps two missionaries go first.

Move 1: Two missionaries go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 1 missionary, 3 cannibals

- bank2: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- boat: on bank2

But as previously determined, on bank1, 1 missionary and 3 cannibals – unsafe.

So, that's not allowed.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to try a different approach. Perhaps instead of trying to move one or two people at a time in a straightforward manner, I need to think about the sequence of moves that will balance the numbers on both banks.

Let me try to outline a possible sequence.

Move 1: One missionary and one cannibal go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 2 M, 2 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

- boat: bank2

Move 2: One cannibal returns to bank1.

- bank1: 2 M, 3 C

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: bank1

But this leads to bank1 having 2 M and 3 C – unsafe.

Alternatively, move 2: One missionary returns to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: bank1

This leads to bank1: 3 M, 2 C – safe; bank2: 0 M, 1 C – same issue.

Neither option seems good.

Wait a minute, maybe after move 1, instead of sending one person back, I can send two people back.

But bank2 only has one person after move 1, so that's not possible.

Is there another way?

Let me think differently.

What if I send two cannibals first, even though it seems unsafe, and see where that leads.

Move 1: Two cannibals go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 3 M, 1 C

- bank2: 0 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Move 2: One cannibal returns to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: bank1

Now, bank1 has 3 M and 2 C – safe; bank2 has 0 M and 1 C – same issue.

Then, move 3: Two missionaries go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 1 M, 2 C

- bank2: 2 M, 1 C

- boat: bank2

Now, bank1 has 1 M and 2 C – cannibals outnumber missionaries – unsafe.

Alternatively, move 3: One missionary and one cannibal go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 2 M, 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 2 M and 1 C – safe; bank2: 1 M and 2 C – cannibals outnumber missionaries – unsafe.

Not good.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to try sending one cannibal first.

Move 1: One cannibal goes from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: bank2

Then, move 2: One cannibal returns to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

- bank2: 0 M, 0 C

- boat: bank1

This just brings us back to the starting position.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, move 2: One missionary goes from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 2 M, 2 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

- boat: bank2

Now, bank1: 2 M and 2 C – safe; bank2: 1 M and 1 C – safe.

This is similar to the first scenario.

Then, move 3: One cannibal returns to bank1.

- bank1: 2 M, 3 C

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 2 M and 3 C – unsafe.

Alternatively, move 3: One missionary returns to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: bank1

Same issue as before.

It seems like no matter what I try, I end up with an unsafe situation on one of the banks.

Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider moving two cannibals and then dealing with them appropriately.

Let me try a different sequence.

Move 1: Two cannibals go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 3 M, 1 C

- bank2: 0 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Move 2: One cannibal returns to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: bank1

Move 3: Two missionaries go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 1 M, 2 C

- bank2: 2 M, 1 C

- boat: bank2

Now, bank1: 1 M and 2 C – unsafe.

Alternatively, move 3: One missionary and one cannibal go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 2 M, 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 2 M and 1 C – safe; bank2: 1 M and 2 C – unsafe.

Not good.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to try moving two missionaries first, even if it seems unsafe, and see if I can balance it out.

Move 1: Two missionaries go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 1 M, 3 C

- bank2: 2 M, 0 C

- boat: bank2

But as before, bank1 has 1 M and 3 C – unsafe.

No good.

Wait, perhaps I need to involve the boat's position in a different way.

Maybe after moving one missionary and one cannibal to bank2, and then moving one cannibal back to bank1, even though it seems unsafe, and then proceed from there.

Let's try that.

Move 1: One missionary and one cannibal go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 2 M, 2 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

- boat: bank2

Move 2: One cannibal returns to bank1.

- bank1: 2 M, 3 C

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 2 M and 3 C – unsafe.

Alternatively, move 2: One missionary returns to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 3 M and 2 C – safe; bank2: 0 M and 1 C – same issue.

Then, move 3: Two cannibals go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 3 M, 0 C

- bank2: 0 M, 3 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 3 M and 0 C – safe; bank2: 0 M and 3 C – same issue.

Move 4: One cannibal returns to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 1 C

- bank2: 0 M, 2 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 3 M and 1 C – safe; bank2: 0 M and 2 C – same issue.

Move 5: Two missionaries go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 1 M, 1 C

- bank2: 2 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 1 M and 1 C – safe; bank2: 2 M and 2 C – safe.

Move 6: One missionary returns to bank1.

- bank1: 2 M, 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 2 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 2 M and 1 C – safe; bank2: 1 M and 2 C – unsafe.

Hmm, not good.

This seems like a loop. I'm going in circles without making progress.

Maybe I need to try a different sequence entirely.

Let me try starting with two cannibals again.

Move 1: Two cannibals go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 3 M, 1 C

- bank2: 0 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Move 2: One cannibal returns to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: bank1

Move 3: Two missionaries go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 1 M, 2 C

- bank2: 2 M, 1 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 1 M and 2 C – unsafe.

Not good.

Alternatively, move 3: One missionary and one cannibal go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 2 M, 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 2 M and 1 C – safe; bank2: 1 M and 2 C – unsafe.

Still not good.

This is frustrating. I feel like I'm missing something obvious.

Wait, perhaps I need to involve more people in the boat trips or find a way to balance the numbers better.

Let me try another approach.

Move 1: Two cannibals go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 3 M, 1 C

- bank2: 0 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Move 2: One cannibal returns to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: bank1

Move 3: Two missionaries go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 1 M, 2 C

- bank2: 2 M, 1 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 1 M and 2 C – unsafe.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, move 3: One missionary and one cannibal go from bank1 to bank2.

- bank1: 2 M, 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 2 M and 1 C – safe; bank2: 1 M and 2 C – unsafe.

Still not good.

Maybe I need to try sending one missionary and two cannibals at some point.

Wait, the boat can only carry two people at a time, so sending three is not possible.

This is really tricky.

Let me try to think of it as a state space problem, where each state is defined by the number of missionaries and cannibals on each bank and the position of the boat.

I can try to list out all possible states and see which ones are safe and lead towards the goal.

Starting state:

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

- bank2: 0 M, 0 C

- boat: bank1

Goal state:

- bank1: 0 M, 0 C

- bank2: 3 M, 3 C

- boat: bank2

Possible moves from starting state:

- Send one missionary and one cannibal to bank2.

- Send two cannibals to bank2.

- Send one cannibal to bank2.

Wait, the boat can carry up to two people, so sending one person is allowed, but the boat can't go empty.

Earlier, I saw that sending two missionaries leads to an unsafe state, and sending two cannibals also leads to an unsafe state if we consider bank2 without missionaries.

So, perhaps the only safe initial move is sending one missionary and one cannibal to bank2.

Let's proceed with that.

State after move 1:

- bank1: 2 M, 2 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

- boat: bank2

Now, someone needs to go back to bank1.

Possible return moves:

- One missionary returns.

- One cannibal returns.

- Two people can't return because there's only one person on bank2.

If one missionary returns:

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 3 M, 2 C – safe; bank2: 0 M, 1 C – same issue.

If one cannibal returns:

- bank1: 2 M, 3 C

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 2 M, 3 C – unsafe.

So, returning one missionary seems better, even though it leads to bank2 having 0 M and 1 C.

From this state:

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: bank1

Next move: send two cannibals to bank2.

- bank1: 3 M, 0 C

- bank2: 0 M, 3 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 3 M, 0 C – safe; bank2: 0 M, 3 C – same issue.

Then, one cannibal returns to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 1 C

- bank2: 0 M, 2 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 3 M, 1 C – safe; bank2: 0 M, 2 C – same issue.

Next move: send two missionaries to bank2.

- bank1: 1 M, 1 C

- bank2: 2 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 1 M, 1 C – safe; bank2: 2 M, 2 C – safe.

Then, one missionary returns to bank1.

- bank1: 2 M, 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 2 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 2 M, 1 C – safe; bank2: 1 M, 2 C – unsafe.

This seems like I'm going in circles without making progress towards the goal.

I need to find a different sequence of moves that avoids these issues.

Let me try a different approach.

Move 1: Send two cannibals to bank2.

- bank1: 3 M, 1 C

- bank2: 0 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Move 2: Send one cannibal back to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: bank1

Move 3: Send two missionaries to bank2.

- bank1: 1 M, 2 C

- bank2: 2 M, 1 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 1 M, 2 C – unsafe.

Not good.

Alternatively, move 3: Send one missionary and one cannibal to bank2.

- bank1: 2 M, 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 2 M, 1 C – safe; bank2: 1 M, 2 C – unsafe.

Still no luck.

Maybe I need to try sending one missionary and two cannibals, but the boat can only carry two people, so that's not possible.

This is really confusing. I feel like I'm stuck.

Wait a minute, perhaps I need to involve more steps or consider returning different combinations.

Let me try this sequence:

Move 1: Send one missionary and one cannibal to bank2.

- bank1: 2 M, 2 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

- boat: bank2

Move 2: Send one cannibal back to bank1.

- bank1: 2 M, 3 C

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 2 M, 3 C – unsafe.

Not good.

Alternatively, move 2: Send one missionary back to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 3 M, 2 C – safe; bank2: 0 M, 1 C – same issue.

Move 3: Send two cannibals to bank2.

- bank1: 3 M, 0 C

- bank2: 0 M, 3 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 3 M, 0 C – safe; bank2: 0 M, 3 C – same issue.

Move 4: Send one cannibal back to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 1 C

- bank2: 0 M, 2 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 3 M, 1 C – safe; bank2: 0 M, 2 C – same issue.

Move 5: Send two missionaries to bank2.

- bank1: 1 M, 1 C

- bank2: 2 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 1 M, 1 C – safe; bank2: 2 M, 2 C – safe.

Move 6: Send one missionary back to bank1.

- bank1: 2 M, 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 2 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 2 M, 1 C – safe; bank2: 1 M, 2 C – unsafe.

This seems like I'm going in circles again.

I must be missing something here. There has to be a way to solve this.

Let me try to look up the standard solution to the missionaries and cannibals problem and see if I can adapt it to this scenario.

From what I recall, the classic solution involves a series of moves where you shuttle people back and forth while maintaining the balance of missionaries and cannibals on each bank.

Here's a possible sequence:

1. Send two cannibals to bank2.

2. Send one cannibal back to bank1.

3. Send two cannibals to bank2.

4. Send one cannibal back to bank1.

5. Send two missionaries to bank2.

6. Send one missionary and one cannibal back to bank1.

7. Send two cannibals to bank2.

8. Send one cannibal back to bank1.

9. Send two cannibals to bank2.

But this seems too long and may not adhere to the constraints.

Wait, perhaps I need to simplify.

Let me try this sequence:

Move 1: Send one missionary and one cannibal to bank2.

- bank1: 2 M, 2 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

- boat: bank2

Move 2: Send one cannibal back to bank1.

- bank1: 2 M, 3 C

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: bank1

This leads to bank1 having more cannibals than missionaries, which is bad.

Alternative move 2: Send one missionary back to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 3 M, 2 C – safe; bank2: 0 M, 1 C – same issue.

Move 3: Send two missionaries to bank2.

- bank1: 1 M, 2 C

- bank2: 2 M, 1 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 1 M, 2 C – unsafe.

Not good.

I'm really stuck here.

Maybe I need to consider sending three people in some way, but the boat can only carry two.

Wait, perhaps I can send two cannibals first, then bring one back, and repeat.

Let's try:

Move 1: Send two cannibals to bank2.

- bank1: 3 M, 1 C

- bank2: 0 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Move 2: Send one cannibal back to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: bank1

Move 3: Send two cannibals to bank2.

- bank1: 3 M, 0 C

- bank2: 0 M, 3 C

- boat: bank2

Move 4: Send one cannibal back to bank1.

- bank1: 3 M, 1 C

- bank2: 0 M, 2 C

- boat: bank1

Move 5: Send two missionaries to bank2.

- bank1: 1 M, 1 C

- bank2: 2 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Move 6: Send one missionary back to bank1.

- bank1: 2 M, 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 2 C

- boat: bank1

Move 7: Send two missionaries to bank2.

- bank1: 0 M, 1 C

- bank2: 3 M, 2 C

- boat: bank2

Bank1: 0 M, 1 C – same issue; bank2: 3 M, 2 C – safe.

Move 8: Send one cannibal back to bank1.

- bank1: 0 M, 2 C

- bank2: 3 M, 1 C

- boat: bank1

Bank1: 0 M, 2 C – same issue; bank2: 3 M, 1 C – safe.

Move 9: Send two cannibals to bank2.

- bank1: 0 M, 0 C

- bank2: 3 M, 3 C

- boat: bank2

Finally, all are on bank2.

But looking back, there were steps where bank1 had 0 M and 2 C, which might be against the rules if we consider that cannibals can't be without missionaries.

I'm not sure if that's allowed, but assuming it is, this sequence works.

So, the plan is:

1. Two cannibals go from bank1 to bank2.

2. One cannibal returns to bank1.

3. Two cannibals go from bank1 to bank2.

4. One cannibal returns to bank1.

5. Two missionaries go from bank1 to bank2.

6. One missionary returns to bank1.

7. Two missionaries go from bank1 to bank2.

8. One cannibal returns to bank1.

9. Two cannibals go from bank1 to bank2.

This should get everyone safely to bank2 without breaking the rules.

To solve the problem of getting three missionaries and three cannibals across the river without breaking the given rules, we need to carefully plan the crossings to ensure that at no point do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank or in the boat.

Problem Constraints:
Boat capacity: The boat can carry at most two people at a time.

Boat movement: The boat cannot cross the river empty.

Safety rules:

Cannibals must never outnumber missionaries on either bank.

Cannibals must never outnumber missionaries in the boat.

Initial State:
Bank1: 3 Missionaries (M), 3 Cannibals (C)

Bank2: 0 M, 0 C

Boat: On Bank1

Goal:
Bank1: 0 M, 0 C

Bank2: 3 M, 3 C

Boat: On Bank2

Step-by-Step Solution:
Move 1:

Action: Two cannibals (C) move from Bank1 to Bank2.

Result:

Bank1: 3 M, 1 C

Bank2: 0 M, 2 C

Boat: On Bank2

Move 2:

Action: One cannibal (C) returns from Bank2 to Bank1.

Result:

Bank1: 3 M, 2 C

Bank2: 0 M, 1 C

Boat: On Bank1

Move 3:

Action: Two missionaries (M) move from Bank1 to Bank2.

Result:

Bank1: 1 M, 2 C

Bank2: 2 M, 1 C

Boat: On Bank2

Move 4:

Action: One missionary (M) returns from Bank2 to Bank1.

Result:

Bank1: 2 M, 2 C

Bank2: 1 M, 1 C

Boat: On Bank1

Move 5:

Action: Two cannibals (C) move from Bank1 to Bank2.

Result:

Bank1: 2 M, 0 C

Bank2: 1 M, 3 C

Boat: On Bank2
