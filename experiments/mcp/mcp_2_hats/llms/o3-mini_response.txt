Thought about missionaries and cannibals problem for 19 seconds
Examining the puzzle constraints

I'm thinking through the constraints: three missionaries and three cannibals need to cross the river, with the boat carrying two at a time. The group's hats and exchanged hats don't seem to affect the cannibal ratio.

Formulating a strategy

I’m developing a plan to transport all missionaries and cannibals to bank2, ensuring the boat's capacity and never having more cannibals than missionaries on either bank or the boat.

Considering hat exchanges

Now I'm looking at how hat exchanges could impact the boat's constraints, but since they can be exchanged, they don't affect the solution's logic.

Laying out the steps

I’m detailing the sequence: transport Cannibals to bank2, return one, repeat with missionaries. This ensures safety without outnumbering constraints.

Assessing boat constraints

I'm examining the boat's capacity and conditions to resolve whether cannibals can outnumber missionaries. This leads me to consider scenarios where the boat carries only cannibals.

Evaluating crossings

I’m noting the analysis of canonical crossings: two cannibals cross, one returns, and two cannibals cross again, ensuring safety by adhering to the constraints.

Simulating crossings

I’m working through the sequence: two cannibals cross, one returns, two cross again, one returns, then two missionaries and one cannibal cross. This pattern continues until all are safely transported.

Ensuring balance

I’m making sure missionaries and cannibals are balanced on each side: one cannibal returns, two missionaries cross, one missionary and one cannibal return, leaving the boat and sending them across.

Protecting the journey

I’m guiding the boat with a detailed plan: two missionaries cross, one cannibal returns, two cannibals cross, one returns, then two cannibals cross again, ensuring a safe trip.

Confirming safety

I’m ensuring each boat move aligns with the conditions: two cannibals or two missionaries, one of each, and one at a time, all while guiding safely.

Managing hat swaps

All hats are distinct, but for simplicity, individuals keep their identity intact unless hat exchanges are specifically needed. This approach helps keep things clear and straightforward.

Introducing hat swaps

I’m considering how hat exchanges might be included if necessary, despite initial plans focusing on individuals retaining their hat identity for safe crossing.

Focusing on safety

I'm mapping out a plan to ensure the boat crossings are safe, considering cannibals and missionaries' movements while adhering to the rule of not leaving more cannibals than missionaries on any side.

Map the course

I’m aligning the boat movements with rules and identifying safe steps, ensuring everyone's safety during ferrying. Progress is steady, maintaining a clear plan for each voyage.

Aligning the ferry

I’m refining the plan to align with ferrying rules, focusing on safe crossings and specific boat trips. This ensures a clear, organized approach to manage the process effectively.

Mapping step verification

I’m confirming that after each crossing, the boat's positioning aligns with the bank's composition, ensuring no unsafe combinations of cannibals and missionaries are left behind.

Below is one correct solution. In what follows we label the three missionaries as M₁, M₂, M₃ and the three cannibals as C₁, C₂, C₃. (Recall that although each person wears a different hat, their hats may be exchanged at any time; in this solution no “hat‐swap” is needed for safety.) Initially, everyone (all three missionaries and all three cannibals) is at bank1 and the boat (which holds one or two people) is at bank1. At every stage the following safety conditions are maintained:

On either bank: If one or more missionaries are present, then the number of cannibals there is not allowed to exceed the number of missionaries.
On the boat: If a missionary is aboard, then the cannibals aboard may not be in a majority.
The plan proceeds as follows. (After each move the boat “lands” at its destination and its passengers disembark; you may imagine that any necessary hat exchanges occur off‐boat or during boarding, as the rules allow.)

Step 1.
Move: Load the boat with cannibals C₁ and C₂ from bank1 and cross to bank2.
Boat contents: {C₁, C₂}

bank1: M₁, M₂, M₃, C₃
bank2: C₁, C₂
Check:

bank1: 3 missionaries vs. 1 cannibal → safe.
bank2: No missionaries, so no risk.
Boat: Only cannibals (and no missionary aboard) → safe.
Step 2.
Move: Return cannibal C₁ in the boat from bank2 to bank1.
Boat contents: {C₁}

bank1: M₁, M₂, M₃, C₃, C₁
bank2: C₂
Check:

bank1: 3 missionaries vs. 2 cannibals → safe.
bank2: 0 missionaries → safe.
Step 3.
Move: Load cannibals C₁ and C₃ from bank1 onto the boat and cross to bank2.
Boat contents: {C₁, C₃}

bank1: M₁, M₂, M₃
bank2: C₂, C₁, C₃
Check:

bank1: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals → safe.
bank2: No missionaries present → safe.
Boat: Only cannibals → safe.
Step 4.
Move: Return cannibal C₂ from bank2 to bank1 in the boat.
Boat contents: {C₂}

bank1: M₁, M₂, M₃, C₂
bank2: C₁, C₃
Check:

bank1: 3 missionaries vs. 1 cannibal → safe.
bank2: 0 missionaries → safe.
Step 5.
Move: Load missionaries M₁ and M₂ from bank1 and cross to bank2 in the boat.
Boat contents: {M₁, M₂}

bank1: M₃, C₂
bank2: C₁, C₃, M₁, M₂
Check:

bank1: 1 missionary vs. 1 cannibal → safe (numbers are equal).
bank2: On landing, although there are now 2 missionaries and 2 cannibals overall (if you count later steps), here note that on bank2 the safety rule applies only if a missionary is present. At this moment, 2 missionaries and 2 cannibals are present, which is acceptable (not “outnumbered”).
Boat: Only missionaries aboard → safe.
Step 6.
Move: Load one missionary and one cannibal from bank2 to return to bank1. For definiteness, choose M₁ and C₁.
Boat contents: {M₁, C₁}

bank1: M₃, C₂, M₁, C₁
bank2: M₂, C₃
Check:

Boat: With one missionary and one cannibal, the numbers are equal → safe.
bank1: 2 missionaries (M₁ and M₃) and 2 cannibals (C₁ and C₂) → safe.
bank2: 1 missionary (M₂) and 1 cannibal (C₃) → safe.
Step 7.
Move: Load missionaries M₁ and M₃ from bank1 onto the boat and cross to bank2.
Boat contents: {M₁, M₃}

bank1: C₂, C₁ (the two cannibals remain)
bank2: M₂, C₃, M₁, M₃
Check:

bank1: Only cannibals remain → safe (since there are no missionaries to be endangered).
bank2: 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal → safe.
Boat: Only missionaries aboard → safe.
Step 8.
Move: Return a single cannibal from bank2 to bank1. Choose C₁ to return.
Boat contents: {C₁}

bank1: C₂, C₁
bank2: M₂, C₃, M₁, M₃
Check:

Both banks remain safe as before.
Step 9.
Move: Finally, load the two remaining cannibals (C₁ and C₂) from bank1 onto the boat and cross to bank2.
Boat contents: {C₁, C₂}

bank1: (empty)
bank2: M₁, M₂, M₃, C₁, C₂, C₃
Check:

All six persons are now safely on bank2.
Summary of Moves
(C₁, C₂) cross from bank1 → bank2.
(C₁) returns from bank2 → bank1.
(C₁, C₃) cross from bank1 → bank2.
(C₂) returns from bank2 → bank1.
(M₁, M₂) cross from bank1 → bank2.
(M₁, C₁) return from bank2 → bank1.
(M₁, M₃) cross from bank1 → bank2.
(C₁) returns from bank2 → bank1.
(C₁, C₂) cross from bank1 → bank2.
After Step 9, all three missionaries and all three cannibals are safely at bank2, with every crossing meeting the capacity, river‐safety, and onboard safety constraints. (Any hat exchanges, though allowed by the rules, are unnecessary in this solution.)

This plan satisfies the conditions of the problem.
