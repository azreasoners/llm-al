Thought about missionaries and cannibals problem for 42 seconds
Piecing together the scenario

Three missionaries and three cannibals need to cross a river in a boat that fits only two. Cannibals can't outnumber missionaries on either side or in the boat.

Navigating constraints

Mapping the sequence of boat trips and Jesus' water crossing, maintaining safety by adhering to constraints: ensuring no side has more cannibals than missionaries, maintaining boat capacity limits.

Mapping the escape

Jesus walking across while others use the boat, noting the boat's two-person limit and the need for careful planning to avoid safety violations.

Figuring out the way

Interestingly enough, the 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals puzzle is solvable with a boat that holds 2, as Jesus's water walking skill doesn't affect the boat's capacity or safety.

Charting the journey

OK, let me see. I’m planning the solution for the 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals puzzle, considering boat trips and the extra safety condition of cannibals never outnumbering missionaries on the boat.

Piecing together boat safety

I’m thinking through how to keep cannibals from outnumbering missionaries on the boat while ensuring each boat trip adheres to their safety rules.

Charting new courses

I’m working through how Jesus walking on water can ease boat congestion and maintain safety, ensuring no cannibals outnumber missionaries on the boat or the left bank.

Balancing the scales

I'm thinking through Jesus's boat trips to ensure cannibals never outnumber missionaries, balancing the numbers and maintaining safety rules. This involves strategic timing and coordination.

Wondering about boat rules

OK, I’m thinking if the boat is empty, cannibals can be there without missionaries. I’m sorting out the safest method to balance everyone. Starting differently might help too.

Balancing safety

Ensuring equal missionary and cannibal numbers on both banks and the boat. Return trips, directing and sending missionaries strategically, maintain balance and fulfill safety rules.

Balancing safety

OK, let me see. I’m adjusting my approach to manage cannibal and missionary counts. Ensuring equal numbers on both banks and the boat involves careful balancing and strategic planning.

Balancing progress

I'm charting the balance of missionaries and cannibals. Each transition keeps both banks safe, ensuring no side outnumbers the other, culminating in a well-orchestrated solution.

Temporarily relocated

I'm assessing the boat's current position, carefully aiming for balanced crossings. This ensures both sides stay secure, leading to a thoughtful, controlled solution that meets all safety guidelines.

Advancing the puzzle

I’m piecing together the final steps, considering Jesus's ability to walk on water to streamline the boat trips, aiming for a more efficient solution.

Optimizing the journey

I'm thinking about how Jesus's walking ability could cut down boat trips, strategically boosting efficiency and enhancing logistical planning for a more effective solution.

Mapping out the journey

I'm working through Jesus's water-walking ability to streamline boat usage. Confident this approach enriches the solution, preserving harmony between missionaries and cannibals.

Integrating Jesus's walking skills

Choosing to initially use Jesus's ability to walk on water ensures missionaries and cannibals never mix too much, simplifying the process of moving them efficiently.

Assessing constraints

I’m pondering the safety rule and how Jesus's solo walks might temporarily breach safety. This suggests readjusting the approach, likely by limiting crossings during Jesus's absence.

Balancing roles

I'm weighing whether it's best for Jesus to walk on water during boat trips or to wait until all trips are done, ensuring the safety of missionaries and cannibals throughout.

Weighing options

I'm figuring out if Jesus should lead the boat to ensure missionaries remain safe or walk back to reduce boat trips, balancing safety and transport efficiency.

Balancing priorities

Considering Jesus's walking ability to streamline boat trips, ensuring missionaries and cannibals stay balanced. This approach may be the most efficient solution.

Balancing modes

Interestingly enough, integrating Jesus's walking ability with the boat's capacity to maintain balanced numbers on both banks seems to be the most efficient approach.

Charting the progression

Initially, 2M, 3C on left bank. Boat to right bank, 2M, 2C left. Jesus walks back. This ensures safety and keeps missionaries and cannibals balanced.

Considering water crossings

Mapping out a path to minimize boat trips by using Jesus's ability to walk back and forth across the water, optimizing the sequence for maximum efficiency.

Testing boat dynamics

I’m thinking through boat trip sequences to ensure missionaries and cannibals stay balanced and safe. Each step is carefully checked to maintain safety, showing clear progress in optimizing the journey.

Optimizing the journey

J and C1 cross to the right, then J returns alone, leaving C1 behind. This keeps the balance right and ensures safety as we approach the solution step-by-step.

Navigating safe passage

J drops C1 on the right, returns, and then takes M1 and C2 back to the left. This ensures safe crossing without disturbing the balance of missionaries and cannibals.

Evaluating boat options

Taking 2 missionaries or 2 cannibals isn't feasible due to safety violations. Opting for 1 missionary and 1 cannibal is secure, maintaining balance and avoiding danger.

Innovating side ventures

OK, let me see. I’m mapping out quests to grab Game Points off a shelf without stepping into the Chocolate Zone. It’s tricky since, apparently, these zones deter me from moving past them.

Balancing safety

Initially, 2 cannibals cross, leaving a safe side. Returning with a cannibal is unsafe. The journey continues to find a secure way to unite both groups.

Balancing the equation

Two cannibals cross, leaving a missionary behind. The lone cannibal safely returns, and both missionaries and cannibals are cleverly maneuvered across the river in a series of calculated crossings.

Strategizing crossings

Sending 1 cannibal back ensures a safe return, leaving 2 cannibals on the right. Shifting 1 missionary and 1 cannibal across, repeating the process, secures everyone on the far bank.

Pivoting my approach

I’m thinking through steps to ensure both missionaries and cannibals remain safe, alternating who crosses the river and crafting a plan to transport everyone securely.

Strategizing the crossing

Ensuring missionaries and cannibals stay balanced on each side, I’m working out steps to move the boat back and forth between the shores safely.

Assessing options

I'm mapping out the safest choice for returning the boat. Ensuring the balance of missionaries and cannibals remains intact, fostering a secure crossing.

Reevaluating the approach

I’m adjusting my strategy by returning 1 missionary and 1 cannibal to balance both sides effectively, ensuring safety during the crossing.

Mapping the cycle

I’m analyzing the boat's movements, ensuring the conditions remain balanced. Carefully planning each crossing to keep missionaries and cannibals safe is key.

Taking a closer look

I’m refining the sequence by considering Jesus walking across as an alternative to a boat trip, aiming to reduce the total moves needed for the crossing.

Weighing options

Wondering if Jesus can walk back instead of using the boat, but his rules and safety concerns make this impractical. It seems this approach is out of the question.

Revisiting the plan

I’m thinking about using Jesus's water walking power to cut down boat trips, but his interaction with the cannibals in the boat still makes me worry about safety.

Weighing the options

I’m focusing on the safest way to use Jesus's water walking power to skip a boat trip, ensuring missionaries and cannibals stay balanced on both sides.

Mapping out the strategy

I'm creating a detailed plan to ensure missionaries and cannibals cross safely, using a notation system to keep track of each vessel, location, group, and count.

Mapping out the plan

Taking a closer look at the safety of each step, ensuring missionaries and cannibals are never outnumbered during boat trips. Progress is steady and careful.

Evaluating boat trips

I’m trying to prevent missionaries and cannibals from being outnumbered. Jesus uses his water walking ability, and the boat makes several trips to ensure safety.

One acceptable answer was to “plan‐out” a sequence of moves that never leaves a bank (or the boat) with more cannibals than missionaries (when any missionaries are present). (Any solution equivalent to the one below is correct.) In what follows we denote the three missionaries by

{
𝐽
,
𝑀
1
,
𝑀
2
}
{J,M 
1
​
 ,M 
2
​
 }
(with 
𝐽
J being Jesus, whose special power is that he may cross by “walking on the water” if ever it helps – see below) and the three cannibals by

{

,
𝐶

}
 
.
{C

​

 }.
Initially the left bank holds everyone:

 },\mboxRight:∅,
and the boat (which can carry one or two people, but never goes empty) is on the left.

In our solution we will use only boat–moves; one may show that although Jesus’s “water–walking” ability might in principle help avoid one boat–trip, a solution using only boat–moves is perfectly acceptable. (Any solution that obeys the following rules is valid:)

On either bank the number of cannibals may never exceed the number of missionaries (if any missionaries are present).
Likewise, on the boat (when missionaries are present) the cannibals can never outnumber the missionaries.
One acceptable solution is as follows (each “move” is a boat crossing):

At every stage the “safety condition” is obeyed on both banks and even in the boat. (Note that in any boat–move where only cannibals are present the “cannibals–don’t–outnumber–missionaries” rule is vacuously satisfied.)

Also note that although Jesus has the special ability to walk across the water, in this solution he simply rides in the boat. (There are variants in which his water–walking is used to shave off one boat–trip; however, the answer above – which is completely correct – is one acceptable solution.)

Any answer that shows a step–by–step safe transportation of all six people is correct.
