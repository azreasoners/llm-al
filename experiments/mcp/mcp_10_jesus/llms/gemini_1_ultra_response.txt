Here's a breakdown of how to represent this problem, along with the steps towards a solution.

Problem Representation

You've done an excellent job defining the key elements:

Types:

vessel
location
group
integer
Instances:

boat (a vessel)
bank1 (a location)
bank2 (a location)
missionaries (a group)
cannibals (a group)
Integers (you'll use these to represent the number of people on each bank and in the boat)
Constraints:

Boat capacity: 2 people at most.
Boat must have at least 1 person.
Cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries on either bank.
Cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries on the boat.
Special rule: Jesus can walk on water.
Solution Approach

This is a classic "state-space search" problem. Here's the general approach:

Define States: A state represents:

Location of the boat (bank1 or bank2)
Number of missionaries on bank1
Number of cannibals on bank1
(The numbers on bank2 are implied, since the total is always three of each)
Initial State:

Boat at bank1
3 missionaries on bank1
3 cannibals on bank1
Goal State:

Boat at bank2
3 missionaries on bank2
3 cannibals on bank2
Possible Actions (Operators): Define what moves are allowed from a given state. For example:

One missionary and one cannibal cross to bank2.
Two missionaries cross to bank2.
Jesus walks across to bank2.
One cannibal crosses to bank2
One cannibal returns to bank1.
... and so on. You need to be careful to define only moves that don't violate the constraints.
Search: Employ an appropriate search algorithm (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, A*) to find a sequence of actions that lead from the initial state to the goal state.

Solution (A Possible Plan)

Here's one potential solution outline. Note that there could be multiple correct solutions.

One missionary and one cannibal cross to bank2.
One cannibal returns to bank1.
Two missionaries cross to bank2.
One cannibal returns to bank1.
Two cannibals cross to bank2.
One cannibal returns to bank1.
Two missionaries cross to bank2.
One missionary and one cannibal cross to bank1.
Jesus walks to bank2.
One missionary and one cannibal cross to bank2.
One cannibal returns to bank1.
One missionary and one cannibal cross to bank2.
Caveats:

This is a simplified solution. A full implementation would need meticulous programming to accurately represent all states, valid actions, and apply a search algorithm.
There might be more efficient or creative solutions than this one.
