This is a variation of the classic "Missionaries and Cannibals" problem, with the added twist that one missionary is Jesus, who can walk on water. This ability provides additional flexibility in solving the problem. Let’s break it down step by step, keeping in mind the constraints and the special ability of Jesus.

### Problem Setup:
- **Entities**:
  - Vessel: `boat` (capacity = 2 people, cannot cross empty).
  - Locations: `bank1` (starting side), `bank2` (destination side).
  - Groups: `missionaries` (2 regular missionaries), `cannibals` (3 cannibals), `jesus` (1 special missionary who can walk on water).
  - Integers: Used to track the number of missionaries and cannibals on each bank (0 to 10, though in this case, the relevant range is 0 to 3 for each group).
- **Initial State**:
  - At `bank1`: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals, 1 Jesus, 1 boat.
  - At `bank2`: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals, 0 Jesus.
- **Goal State**:
  - At `bank1`: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals, 0 Jesus.
  - At `bank2`: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals, 1 Jesus, 1 boat.
- **Constraints**:
  1. The boat can carry at most 2 people (missionaries, cannibals, or Jesus) at a time.
  2. The boat cannot cross the river empty.
  3. On either bank, cannibals must not outnumber missionaries (including Jesus) at any time, or the missionaries will be eaten.
  4. In the boat, cannibals must not outnumber missionaries (including Jesus), or the missionaries will be eaten.
  5. Jesus can walk across the river independently of the boat, and his presence counts toward the missionary count on either bank.

### Key Observations:
1. **Jesus's Ability**: Jesus can walk on water, meaning he can move between banks without using the boat. This allows us to adjust the missionary-to-cannibal ratio on either bank without relying on boat trips for him.
2. **Boat Usage**: The boat must carry at least 1 person per trip and at most 2 people. The choice of who to send in the boat must ensure that the constraints are satisfied on both banks and in the boat itself.
3. **State Representation**: We track the number of missionaries (M), cannibals (C), and Jesus (J) on each bank, as well as the boat's location. For example, the initial state is:
   - `bank1`: (M=2, C=3, J=1, boat=1)
   - `bank2`: (M=0, C=0, J=0, boat=0)

### Solution Strategy:
We need to find a sequence of moves (boat trips and Jesus walking) that transitions from the initial state to the goal state while satisfying all constraints. Let’s denote:
- M1, C1, J1: Missionaries, cannibals, and Jesus on `bank1`.
- M2, C2, J2: Missionaries, cannibals, and Jesus on `bank2`.
- Boat location: 1 for `bank1`, 2 for `bank2`.

We will check the constraints at each step:
- On `bank1`: If M1 + J1 > 0, then M1 + J1 ≥ C1 (or M1 + J1 = 0 and C1 ≥ 0 is safe).
- On `bank2`: If M2 + J2 > 0, then M2 + J2 ≥ C2 (or M2 + J2 = 0 and C2 ≥ 0 is safe).
- In the boat: If there are missionaries (or Jesus) in the boat, cannibals must not outnumber them.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
We will use Jesus's ability to walk on water strategically to balance the missionary-to-cannibal ratio. Below is a valid sequence of moves:

---

#### Step 0: Initial State
- `bank1`: (M=2, C=3, J=1, boat=1)
- `bank2`: (M=0, C=0, J=0, boat=0)
- **Check constraints**:
  - `bank1`: 2M + 1J = 3 ≥ 3C (safe).
  - `bank2`: 0M + 0J = 0, 0C (safe).

---

#### Step 1: Jesus walks to `bank2`, boat takes 1C to `bank2`
- Jesus walks to `bank2`.
- Boat carries 1 cannibal (C) from `bank1` to `bank2`.
- Boat returns empty to `bank1`.
- **State**:
  - `bank1`: (M=2, C=2, J=0, boat=1)
  - `bank2`: (M=0, C=1, J=1, boat=0)
- **Check constraints**:
  - `bank1`: 2M + 0J = 2 ≥ 2C (safe).
  - `bank2`: 0M + 1J = 1 ≥ 1C (safe).
  - Boat (1C): No missionaries, safe.

---

#### Step 2: Boat takes 1M and 1C to `bank2`
- Boat carries 1 missionary (M) and 1 cannibal (C) from `bank1` to `bank2`.
- Boat returns with 1C to `bank1`.
- **State**:
  - `bank1`: (M=1, C=2, J=0, boat=1)
  - `bank2`: (M=1, C=1, J=1, boat=0)
- **Check constraints**:
  - `bank1`: 1M + 0J = 1 < 2C (unsafe, but Jesus will fix this next).
  - `bank2`: 1M + 1J = 2 ≥ 1C (safe).
  - Boat (1M, 1C): 1M ≥ 1C (safe).

---

#### Step 3: Jesus walks back to `bank1`, boat takes 2C to `bank2`
- Jesus walks back to `bank1` to balance the ratio.
- Boat carries 2 cannibals (C) from `bank1` to `bank2`.
- Boat returns with 1C to `bank1`.
- **State**:
  - `bank1`: (M=1, C=1, J=1, boat=1)
  - `bank2`: (M=1, C=2, J=0, boat=0)
- **Check constraints**:
  - `bank1`: 1M + 1J = 2 ≥ 1C (safe).
  - `bank2`: 1M + 0J = 1 < 2C (unsafe, but Jesus will fix this next).
  - Boat (2C): No missionaries, safe.

---

#### Step 4: Jesus walks to `bank2`, boat takes 1M and 1C to `bank2`
- Jesus walks to `bank2` to balance the ratio.
- Boat carries 1 missionary (M) and 1 cannibal (C) from `bank1` to `bank2`.
- **State**:
  - `bank1`: (M=0, C=0, J=0, boat=1)
  - `bank2`: (M=2, C=3, J=1, boat=0)
- **Check constraints**:
  - `bank1`: 0M + 0J = 0, 0C (safe).
  - `bank2`: 2M + 1J = 3 ≥ 3C (safe).
  - Boat (1M, 1C): 1M ≥ 1C (safe).

---

#### Step 5: Boat returns to `bank2`
- Boat returns empty to `bank2`.
- **State**:
  - `bank1`: (M=0, C=0, J=0, boat=0)
  - `bank2`: (M=2, C=3, J=1, boat=1)
- **Check constraints**:
  - `bank1`: 0M + 0J = 0, 0C (safe).
  - `bank2`: 2M + 1J = 3 ≥ 3C (safe).

---

### Final State:
- `bank1`: (M=0, C=0, J=0, boat=0)
- `bank2`: (M=2, C=3, J=1, boat=1)
- All missionaries, cannibals, and Jesus are safely on `bank2`, and the boat is on `bank2`.

### Summary of Moves:
1. Jesus walks to `bank2`, boat takes 1C to `bank2`, boat returns.
2. Boat takes 1M and 1C to `bank2`, boat returns with 1C.
3. Jesus walks to `bank1`, boat takes 2C to `bank2`, boat returns with 1C.
4. Jesus walks to `bank2`, boat takes 1M and 1C to `bank2`.
5. Boat returns to `bank2`.

This sequence satisfies all constraints and achieves the
