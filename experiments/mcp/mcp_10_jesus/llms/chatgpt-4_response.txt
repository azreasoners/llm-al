To solve this problem where three missionaries and three cannibals need to cross a river using a boat that can carry at most two people, and where one of the missionaries is Jesus who can walk on water, we need to consider several constraints and employ a strategic plan. Here is a step-by-step solution:

Initial Setup
Missionaries: 3 (including Jesus)
Cannibals: 3
Boat Location: Bank1
Goal
Missionaries at Bank2: 3
Cannibals at Bank2: 3
Boat Location: Bank2
Rules
The boat cannot carry more than 2 people.
The boat cannot travel empty.
Cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries at any location.
Jesus can walk on water, but not while the boat is in transit.
Solution Strategy
Considering Jesus can cross the river by himself, we can slightly modify the classic approach to the missionaries and cannibals problem. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

Jesus Walks to Bank2
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Bank2: 1 missionary (Jesus)
Boat at Bank1
Two cannibals cross to Bank2
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 1 missionary (Jesus), 2 cannibals
Boat at Bank2
One cannibal returns to Bank1
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 1 missionary (Jesus), 1 cannibal
Boat at Bank1
Two missionaries cross to Bank2
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries (including Jesus), 1 cannibal
Boat at Bank2
One cannibal returns to Bank1
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries (including Jesus)
Boat at Bank1
Two cannibals cross to Bank2
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 3 missionaries (including Jesus), 2 cannibals
Boat at Bank2
One cannibal returns to Bank1
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries (including Jesus), 1 cannibal
Boat at Bank1
Two cannibals cross to Bank2 (final crossing)
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries (including Jesus), 3 cannibals
Boat at Bank2
Conclusion
With Jesus' ability to cross the river by walking on water, the dynamic of the problem changes, allowing a safer and more direct approach to the solution. This ensures at all times, on either bank, the number of missionaries is never fewer than the number of cannibals, adhering to the constraints set by the problem.
