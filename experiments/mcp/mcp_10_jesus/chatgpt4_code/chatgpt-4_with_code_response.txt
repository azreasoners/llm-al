RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison
It looks like the recursive solution led to exceeding the maximum recursion depth, suggesting an issue with repeated states leading to infinite loops or the depth of recursion being too deep for the problem size. To address this, I'll introduce memoization to avoid re-exploring previously visited states. This should prevent the function from entering infinite recursion by keeping track of states that have already been processed.

Let's revise the code to include this enhancement. ​​

The revised solution has generated a sequence of actions for crossing the river. Each action is a tuple in the form 
(
missionaries
,
cannibals
,
direction
)
(missionaries,cannibals,direction), where the direction is 1 for moving to bank2 and 2 for moving back to bank1. The sequence details the steps needed for all missionaries and cannibals to safely cross the river:

Two cannibals cross to bank2.
One cannibal returns to bank1.
Two cannibals cross to bank2 again.
One cannibal returns to bank1.
Two missionaries cross to bank2.
One missionary and one cannibal return to bank1.
Two missionaries cross to bank2 again.
One cannibal returns to bank1.
Two cannibals cross to bank2.
One cannibal returns to bank1.
Two cannibals cross to bank2.
This sequence ensures that at no point do cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank or on the boat, adhering to the rules of the problem. ​
