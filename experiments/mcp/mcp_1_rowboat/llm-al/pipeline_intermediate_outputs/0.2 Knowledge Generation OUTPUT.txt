% Crossing a vessel causes the location of the vessel to change to the opposite bank.
% The starting location is the current location of the vessel before the crossing.
% The destination location is the opposite bank of the starting location.
% Crossing a vessel causes numMissCrossing(V) missionaries to move from the starting location to the destination location.
% Crossing a vessel causes numCannCrossing(V) cannibals to move from the starting location to the destination location.
% The number of missionaries at a location after crossing equals the number of missionaries at that location before crossing plus or minus the number of missionaries moving.
% The number of cannibals at a location after crossing equals the number of cannibals at that location before crossing plus or minus the number of cannibals moving.
% The action cross(V) is not executable if numMissCrossing(V) + numCannCrossing(V) > 2.
% The action cross(V) is not executable if numMissCrossing(V) + numCannCrossing(V) < 1.
% The action cross(V) is not executable if numMissCrossing(V) < 0 or numCannCrossing(V) < 0.
% The action cross(V) is not executable if numMissCrossing(V) > numMissAt(starting location).
% The action cross(V) is not executable if numCannCrossing(V) > numCannAt(starting location).
% The action cross(V) is not executable if, during the crossing, the number of cannibals on the vessel exceeds the number of missionaries on the vessel when there is at least one missionary on the vessel.
% After crossing, at any location, the number of cannibals cannot exceed the number of missionaries when there is at least one missionary at that location.
% The number of missionaries and cannibals at any location cannot be negative.
% The total number of missionaries at both locations must always sum to three.
% The total number of cannibals at both locations must always sum to three.
