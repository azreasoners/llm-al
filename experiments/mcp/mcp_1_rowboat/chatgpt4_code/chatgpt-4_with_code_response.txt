I've developed a Python program that finds a solution to the missionaries and cannibals problem. Here's a valid sequence of moves where the tuple represents the number of missionaries and cannibals moved:

Move 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
Return 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Move 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
Return 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Move 2 missionaries from bank1 to bank2.
Return 1 missionary and 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Move 2 missionaries from bank1 to bank2.
Return 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Move 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
Return 1 cannibal from bank2 to bank1.
Move 2 cannibals from bank1 to bank2.
This sequence ensures that at no point do cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank or on the boat, thus providing a safe crossing for all. â€‹
