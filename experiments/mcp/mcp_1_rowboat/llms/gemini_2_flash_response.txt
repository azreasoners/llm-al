Here's a step-by-step solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, using the provided terminology:

Initial State:

bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, rowboat
bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Moves (numbered for clarity):

Move 1: 2 cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.

bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals, rowboat
Move 2: 1 cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1.

bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals, rowboat
bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 3: 2 missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2.

bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals
bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal, rowboat
Move 4: 1 missionary and 1 cannibal return from bank2 to bank1.

bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals, rowboat
bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals
Move 5: 2 missionaries cross from bank1 to bank2.

bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals, rowboat
Move 6: 1 cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1.

bank1: 0 missionaries, 4 cannibals, rowboat
bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Move 7: 2 cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.

bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals, rowboat
Move 8: 1 cannibal returns from bank2 to bank1.

bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals, rowboat
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 9: 2 cannibals cross from bank1 to bank2.

bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, rowboat
