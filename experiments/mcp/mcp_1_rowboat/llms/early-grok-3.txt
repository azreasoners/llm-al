This is a classic river-crossing puzzle, and we need to solve it while adhering to the constraints provided. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### **Problem Analysis**
- **Entities**:
  - **Vessel**: `rowboat` (capacity = 2 people, cannot cross empty).
  - **Locations**: `bank1` (starting side), `bank2` (destination side).
  - **Groups**: `missionaries` (3 total), `cannibals` (3 total).
  - **Integers**: Used to track the number of missionaries and cannibals at each location or in the rowboat (0 to 10, but relevant values here are 0 to 3 for each group).

- **Constraints**:
  1. The rowboat can carry at most 2 people (missionaries or cannibals) at a time.
  2. The rowboat cannot cross the river empty (at least 1 person must be in it).
  3. On either bank, the number of cannibals must not exceed the number of missionaries (unless no missionaries are present). Otherwise, the missionaries will be eaten.
  4. In the rowboat, the number of cannibals must not exceed the number of missionaries (unless no missionaries are present). Otherwise, the missionaries will be eaten.
  5. Initially, all 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, and the rowboat are on `bank1`.
  6. The goal is to get all 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals to `bank2` without violating the constraints.

- **State Representation**:
  - We can represent the state as `(M1, C1, B, M2, C2)` where:
    - `M1`: Number of missionaries on `bank1`.
    - `C1`: Number of cannibals on `bank1`.
    - `B`: Location of the rowboat (`bank1` or `bank2`).
    - `M2`: Number of missionaries on `bank2`.
    - `C2`: Number of cannibals on `bank2`.
  - Initial state: `(3, 3, bank1, 0, 0)`.
  - Goal state: `(0, 0, bank2, 3, 3)`.

- **Safety Check**:
  - For each bank:
    - If there are missionaries (`M > 0`), then `C ≤ M` (cannibals must not outnumber missionaries).
    - If `M = 0`, any number of cannibals is safe.
  - For the rowboat:
    - If there are missionaries in the boat (`M > 0`), then `C ≤ M`.
    - If `M = 0`, any number of cannibals is safe.

### **Solution Strategy**
We need to find a sequence of moves (crossings) that transitions from the initial state to the goal state while satisfying all constraints. Each move involves:
1. Deciding how many missionaries (`m`) and cannibals (`c`) to transport in the rowboat (where `m + c ≤ 2` and `m + c ≥ 1`).
2. Checking that the rowboat configuration is safe (`c ≤ m` if `m > 0`).
3. Checking that both banks remain safe after the move.

We will solve this by listing the states and transitions step by step.

### **Step-by-Step Solution**
We use the notation `(M1, C1, B, M2, C2)` for states and describe each move.

1. **Initial State**: `(3, 3, bank1, 0, 0)`.
   - All missionaries and cannibals are on `bank1`, and the rowboat is on `bank1`.

2. **Move 1**: Take 1 missionary and 1 cannibal to `bank2`.
   - Rowboat: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal (safe, `1 ≤ 1`).
   - New state: `(2, 2, bank2, 1, 1)`.
   - Check safety:
     - `bank1`: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals (safe, `2 ≤ 2`).
     - `bank2`: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal (safe, `1 ≤ 1`).

3. **Move 2**: Return 1 missionary to `bank1`.
   - Rowboat: 1 missionary (safe, no cannibals).
   - New state: `(3, 2, bank1, 0, 1)`.
   - Check safety:
     - `bank1`: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals (safe, `2 ≤ 3`).
     - `bank2`: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal (safe, no missionaries).

4. **Move 3**: Take 2 cannibals to `bank2`.
   - Rowboat: 2 cannibals (safe, no missionaries).
   - New state: `(3, 0, bank2, 0, 3)`.
   - Check safety:
     - `bank1`: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals (safe, no cannibals).
     - `bank2`: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals (safe, no missionaries).

5. **Move 4**: Return 1 cannibal to `bank1`.
   - Rowboat: 1 cannibal (safe, no missionaries).
   - New state: `(3, 1, bank1, 0, 2)`.
   - Check safety:
     - `bank1`: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal (safe, `1 ≤ 3`).
     - `bank2`: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals (safe, no missionaries).

6. **Move 5**: Take 2 missionaries to `bank2`.
   - Rowboat: 2 missionaries (safe, no cannibals).

### **Final Plan**
The sequence of moves is as follows (each move lists the number of missionaries and cannibals taken in the rowboat and the direction):

1. Take 1 missionary, 1 cannibal from `bank1` to `bank2`.
2. Return 1 missionary from `bank2` to `bank1`.
3. Take 2 cannibals from `bank1` to `bank2`.
4. Return
