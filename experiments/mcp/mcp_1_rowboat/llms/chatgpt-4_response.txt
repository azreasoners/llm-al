To solve the problem of transferring three missionaries and three cannibals from bank1 to bank2 using a rowboat that carries at most two people, we need to devise a sequence of moves that ensures the cannibals never outnumber the missionaries at any location at any time. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step plan:

Start:
Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, rowboat
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Move 1:
Take 1 missionary and 1 cannibal across to bank2.
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal, rowboat
Move 2:
Return 1 cannibal to bank1.
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals, rowboat
Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals
Move 3:
Take 2 cannibals across to bank2.
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals, rowboat
Move 4:
Return 1 missionary and 1 cannibal to bank1.
Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals, rowboat
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 5:
Take 2 missionaries across to bank2.
Bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal, rowboat
Move 6:
Return 1 missionary and 1 cannibal to bank1.
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals, rowboat
Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals
Move 7:
Take 2 missionaries across to bank2.
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals, rowboat
Move 8:
Return 1 cannibal to bank1.
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 4 cannibals, rowboat
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Move 9:
Take 2 cannibals across to bank2.
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals, rowboat
Move 10:
Return 1 cannibal to bank1.
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals, rowboat
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 11:
Take 2 cannibals across to bank2.
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, rowboat
This sequence safely transfers all three missionaries and three cannibals from bank1 to bank2 without ever allowing the cannibals to outnumber the missionaries on either bank or on the rowboat.
