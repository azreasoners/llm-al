Two cannibals take the rowboat from bank1 to bank2.

Location bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Location bank2: 2 cannibals


One cannibal returns in the rowboat from bank2 to bank1.

Location bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Location bank2: 1 cannibal


Two missionaries take the rowboat from bank1 to bank2.

Location bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals
Location bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal


One missionary and one cannibal return in the rowboat from bank2 to bank1.

Location bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Location bank2: 1 missionary


Two cannibals take the rowboat from bank1 to bank2.

Location bank1: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Location bank2: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals

At the end of this plan, all missionaries and cannibals are safely at bank2, and the conditions are met throughout the process.
