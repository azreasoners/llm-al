Thought about missionaries and cannibals puzzle for 29 seconds
Reevaluating constraints

I’m mapping out the modified cannibals and missionaries problem. The new rule prohibits cannibals from outnumbering missionaries on the boat and adds a safety condition that must be considered while developing a valid plan.

Recall and fit

I’m examining a known solution for the missionaries and cannibals problem with Boat capacity 2. The sequence avoids cannibals outnumbering missionaries on the boat, specifically when a missionary is present.

Trying another way

I tested a new sequence to dodge the cannibals-outnumbering-missionaries rule. It felt safe when a missionary wasn't on board, though adjustments were needed for balanced progress and safety.

Revisiting constraints

I checked the boat's safety with cannibals and missionaries. The sequence needed adjustments since cannibals outnumbered missionaries, violating the rule.

Piecing together solutions

I’m working through known solutions for 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals, ensuring cannibals don’t outnumber missionaries on either bank. Valid sequences are identified and reviewed.

Calculating combinations

I’m tallying valid move sequences for 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals, ensuring safe boat composition by avoiding cannibals outnumbering missionaries during crossing. Now I’m digging into combinations.

Mapping progress

Calculating safe boat compositions and valid sequences for guarantees, considering constraints and rules, to ensure all passengers reach the right bank safely.

Ensuring the strategy

I’m confirming each movement sequence for 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals, ensuring no cannibals outnumber missionaries during crossings. This aligns with safe and valid sequences.

Ensuring safe progression

Interestingly enough, I’m verifying each movement for 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals to maintain the rule of avoiding cannibals outnumbering missionaries on any side, ensuring a safe journey.

Verifying step-by-step

I’m making sure each movement for 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals avoids shipwrecks or drowning by checking each intermediate state for ship roles and movement validity.

Evaluating alternative routes

I'm mapping out a detailed sequence of 11 moves, including checking each intermediate state for safety and validity. This involves coordinating ship roles and ensuring the non-outnumbering rule.

Validating each move

I’m ensuring the boat never carries more cannibals than missionaries during each crossing, maintaining safety and avoiding shipwrecks. This ensures a secure transition of all passengers.

Ensuring safety on the boat

I'm mapping out 11 crossings, ensuring no leg has more cannibals than missionaries. Carefully tracking each step confirms this, maintaining the safety of everyone involved.

Calibrating the movements

I’m double-checking each crossing, ensuring the boat never conveys more cannibals than missionaries. Each move is placed carefully to confirm their safe and valid transition.

Below is one acceptable solution. In our notation a “move” is written as

  (m, c): from → to

meaning that m missionaries and c cannibals ride the rowboat from the “from‐bank” to the “to‐bank.” (Remember that the rowboat always carries at least one person and at most two, and if any missionaries are present on the boat then the number of cannibals on the boat must not exceed the number of missionaries.)

We start with

Bank1 (left bank): 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Bank2 (right bank): 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Rowboat: at Bank1
Also, on either bank the rule is that if missionaries are present then they cannot be outnumbered by cannibals.

A valid solution is as follows (each step is chosen so that the conditions are met on both banks and on the boat):

Move (1,1) from Bank1 to Bank2.
After move:

Bank1: 3–1 = 2 missionaries, 3–1 = 2 cannibals
Bank2: 0+1 = 1 missionary, 0+1 = 1 cannibal
Boat is at Bank2.
(On the boat, 1 missionary and 1 cannibal: safe since 1 = 1.)
Move (1,0) from Bank2 to Bank1.
After move:

Bank1: 2+1 = 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 1–1 = 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Boat is at Bank1.
Move (0,2) from Bank1 to Bank2.
After move:

Bank1: cannibals: 2–2 = 0 cannibals (missionaries remain 3)
Bank2: cannibals: 1+2 = 3 cannibals (missionaries remain 0)
Boat is at Bank2.
(The boat carries 2 cannibals only, which is safe.)
Move (0,1) from Bank2 to Bank1.
After move:

Bank1: cannibals: 0+1 = 1 cannibal (missionaries still 3)
Bank2: cannibals: 3–1 = 2 cannibals
Boat is at Bank1.
Move (2,0) from Bank1 to Bank2.
After move:

Bank1: missionaries: 3–2 = 1 missionary (cannibals remain 1)
Bank2: missionaries: 0+2 = 2 missionaries (cannibals remain 2)
Boat is at Bank2.
Move (1,1) from Bank2 to Bank1.
After move:

Bank1: missionaries: 1+1 = 2 missionaries; cannibals: 1+1 = 2 cannibals
Bank2: missionaries: 2–1 = 1 missionary; cannibals: 2–1 = 1 cannibal
Boat is at Bank1.
Move (2,0) from Bank1 to Bank2.
After move:

Bank1: missionaries: 2–2 = 0 missionaries; cannibals remain 2 cannibals
Bank2: missionaries: 1+2 = 3 missionaries; cannibals remain 1 cannibal
Boat is at Bank2.
(Bank1 has 0 missionaries so the rule does not apply there.)
Move (0,1) from Bank2 to Bank1.
After move:

Bank1: cannibals: 2+1 = 3 cannibals
Bank2: cannibals: 1–1 = 0 cannibals (missionaries still 3)
Boat is at Bank1.
Move (0,2) from Bank1 to Bank2.
After move:

Bank1: cannibals: 3–2 = 1 cannibal (missionaries 0)
Bank2: cannibals: 0+2 = 2 cannibals (missionaries 3)
Boat is at Bank2.
Move (0,1) from Bank2 to Bank1.
After move:

Bank1: cannibals: 1+1 = 2 cannibals
Bank2: cannibals: 2–1 = 1 cannibal
Boat is at Bank1.
Move (0,2) from Bank1 to Bank2.
After move:

Bank1: cannibals: 2–2 = 0 cannibals
Bank2: cannibals: 1+2 = 3 cannibals (missionaries still 3)
Boat is at Bank2.
At the end of step 11 we have:

Bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Boat: at Bank2
Every move obeys the rules (each boat crossing is safe, and on both banks the missionaries are never outnumbered when present). (Any sequence of moves that meets the conditions is acceptable.)

Summary of Moves
(1,1): Bank1 → Bank2
(1,0): Bank2 → Bank1
(0,2): Bank1 → Bank2
(0,1): Bank2 → Bank1
(2,0): Bank1 → Bank2
(1,1): Bank2 → Bank1
(2,0): Bank1 → Bank2
(0,1): Bank2 → Bank1
(0,2): Bank1 → Bank2
(0,1): Bank2 → Bank1
(0,2): Bank1 → Bank2
This is one complete plan that solves the puzzle.
