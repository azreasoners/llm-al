Absolutely!  Here's the classic missionaries and cannibals problem, along with a step-by-step solution.

Understanding the Rules

Boat Capacity: The boat can carry a maximum of 2 people.

Notations

M: Missionaries
C: Cannibals
B: Boat
Starting State:

bank1: 3M, 3C, B
bank2: 0M, 0C

Goal State:

bank1: 0M, 0C

bank2: 3M, 3C, B

Solution

Here's a step-by-step plan to get everyone across safely:

2C cross to bank2:
bank1: 1M, 1C, B bank2: 2C
1C returns to bank1:
bank1: 1M, 2C, B bank2: 1C
2M cross to bank2:
bank1: 0M, 2C, B
bank2: 3M, 1C
1M and 1C return to bank1: bank1: 1M, 3C, B bank2: 2M, 0C
2C cross to bank2: bank1: 1M, 1C, B bank2: 2M, 2C
1C returns to bank1: bank1: 1M, 2C, B bank2: 2M, 1C
2M cross to bank2:
bank1: 0M, 2C, B bank2: 3M, 3C
1C returns to bank1: bank1: 0M, 3C, B bank2: 3M, 2C
2C cross to bank2: bank1: 0M, 0C, B bank2: 3M, 3C
Success! Everyone has crossed the river safely.
