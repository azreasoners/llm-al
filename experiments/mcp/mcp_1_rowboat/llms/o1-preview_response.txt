Balancing the operation

I'm thinking through the dynamics of moving three missionaries and three cannibals across a river, ensuring safety and no group is left behind.

Formulating the plan

I’m focusing on transporting six people across a river in a boat that holds two without leaving missionaries outnumbered by cannibals. This involves a logical puzzle with specific constraints.

OK, let me see. The problem needs to ensure missionaries are never outnumbered by cannibals on either side or in the boat.

Mapping out the plan

OK, let's brainstorm a sequence to transport all missionaries and cannibals to bank2, ensuring the cannibals never outnumber the missionaries on the boat.

Crafting a strategy

I’m thinking about solving the boat-crossing problem by carefully analyzing each step to ensure missionaries aren't outnumbered by cannibals. Initially, I label the missionaries and cannibals for clarity, but consider if it's necessary.

Mapping the journey

I’m figuring out the initial setup with 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals on Bank1, aiming to get everyone to Bank2. The boat's capacity is key, and we need to avoid cannibals outnumbering missionaries on either bank.

Mapping options

I’m mapping out different scenarios for ferrying cannibals and missionaries. Sending two cannibals from Bank1 to Bank2 works, given the boat and bank constraints.

Navigating the situation

Considering the scenario on Bank2 with 2 cannibals and 0 missionaries, it seems the cannibals won't outnumber missionaries since there aren't any missionaries present.

Evaluating return options

I'm mapping out alternative ways for a cannibal to return the boat while ensuring the safety of the missionaries. The goal is to avoid situations where cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank.

Evaluating boat movements

Sending one missionary and one cannibal to Bank2 is the best move. Next, I'll think through the returns.

Laying out the options

Thinking through the scenario, if the boat lacks missionaries, cannibals can still go back alone since the missionaries can't be outnumbered when empty.

Navigating options

Considering sending a cannibal back alone, but avoiding outnumbering missionaries. Instead, sending a single missionary back is viable and safe.

Evaluating crossing options

I’m considering various methods to prevent cannibals from outnumbering missionaries on either side of the river, ensuring a safe and strategic crossing.

Evaluating options

Sending two missionaries to Bank2 while avoiding cannibal overpopulation. Next, I'm figuring out the safest way to get the boat back to Bank1.

Evaluating options

OK, let me see. The boat is at Bank2. Sending 2M there leaves 2C on Bank1. No missionaries at risk. Returning 1C brings boat back, avoiding any harm.

Mapping the strategy

I’m guiding the boat with 2 missionaries and 2 cannibals from Bank1 to Bank2, then sending 1 cannibal back. This ensures the boat is unbalanced, leading to a successful plan.

Transporting the cannibals

I’m thinking through the movement of the boat and understanding the options. The goal is to shuttle both missionaries and cannibals across the river while avoiding conflicts.

Crossing the line

First, two cannibals cross to Bank2. Sending one back to Bank1 ensures the boat isn't empty. Finally, the remaining two cannibals cross to Bank2.

Crafting the plan

I’ve mapped out a strategy to safely transfer all missionaries and cannibals across the river in 9 steps. Each step ensures that no group is left alone with the cannibals.

Formulating the plan

I’m noting that using the vessel to transport groups between banks while adhering to constraints is the strategy. The plan will be formalized to ensure missionaries are never outnumbered.

Charting the course

I’m mapping out the steps for moving missionaries and cannibals from one bank to another using a rowboat, ensuring each group transition is clear and manageable.

To solve the Missionaries and Cannibals problem under the given constraints, we need to plan a sequence of moves that ensures the safety of the missionaries at all times. Below is the step-by-step plan:

Definitions:

Vessel: Rowboat
Locations: Bank1 (starting bank), Bank2 (destination bank)
Groups: Missionaries, Cannibals
Integers: Represent the number of individuals in a group
Plan:

Move 1 missionary and 1 cannibal from Bank1 to Bank2 using the rowboat.

Boat Location: Moves to Bank2
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
Move 1 missionary from Bank2 back to Bank1 using the rowboat.

Boat Location: Returns to Bank1
Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 2 cannibals from Bank1 to Bank2 using the rowboat.

Boat Location: Moves to Bank2
Bank1: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Move 1 cannibal from Bank2 back to Bank1 using the rowboat.

Boat Location: Returns to Bank1
Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 2 missionaries from Bank1 to Bank2 using the rowboat.

Boat Location: Moves to Bank2
Bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 1 missionary and 1 cannibal from Bank2 back to Bank1 using the rowboat.

Boat Location: Returns to Bank1
Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal
Move 2 missionaries from Bank1 to Bank2 using the rowboat.

Boat Location: Moves to Bank2
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move 1 cannibal from Bank2 back to Bank1 using the rowboat.

Boat Location: Returns to Bank1
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Move 2 cannibals from Bank1 to Bank2 using the rowboat.

Boat Location: Moves to Bank2
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Move 1 cannibal from Bank2 back to Bank1 using the rowboat.

Boat Location: Returns to Bank1
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal
Move the final 2 cannibals from Bank1 to Bank2 using the rowboat.

Boat Location: Moves to Bank2
Bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals
Bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals
Outcome: All three missionaries and all three cannibals are safely on Bank2. At every step, the number of cannibals never outnumbers the number of missionaries on either bank or in the rowboat, thus adhering to all the constraints.
