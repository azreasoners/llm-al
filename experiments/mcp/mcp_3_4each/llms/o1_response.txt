Thought about missionaries and cannibals puzzle for 1m 35s
Analyzing constraints

I’m piecing together the constraints of the missionaries and cannibals puzzle, ensuring missionaries are never outnumbered by cannibals on the boat or either bank during the crossing.

Navigating the boat

I’m ensuring the boat's side composition aligns with puzzle rules when a cannibal returns, and missionaries can be outnumbered without outnumbering the boat on the crossing side.

Analyzing constraints

I'm thinking through the constraints: the boat can carry cannibals without missionaries since missionaries aren't present, so their lower count isn't a concern.

Clarifying constraints

If no missionaries are on the boat, cannibals can outnumber one another, as there are no missionaries to be eaten or outnumbered.

Reevaluating constraints

Cannibals on the boat with no missionaries may seem permissible since missionaries can't be eaten. However, the puzzle's rules indicate this scenario is not allowed.

Ensuring boat constraints

I’m refining the puzzle rules to ensure the boat always carries at least as many missionaries as cannibals, except in cases where no missionaries are present if a cannibal is aboard.

Balancing the boat

Ensuring the boat always has at least as many missionaries as cannibals, with a total capacity of 2, to avoid any missionaries being eaten.

Setting up crossings

I’m planning to start with 1M,1C on the boat, verifying it keeps the boat's capacity and rules intact. Then, I'll explore the best way to return part of the way for the next trip.

Ensuring constraints

I’m thinking through the boat's composition to meet constraints: ensuring missionaries and cannibals are balanced on both banks. The boat's side composition must align with these rules.

Evaluating crossing options

I’m assessing the next potential crossings, balancing missionaries and cannibals on both banks to avoid rule violations. It’s interesting to see how each option affects the current state.

Assessing options

Returning 1M or 1C would disrupt the balance of missionaries and cannibals on the boat, leading to potential rule violations. This poses a significant challenge.

Weighing crossing routes

Placing 2M or 1M alone on the boat is faltering, as it disrupts the missionary-cannibal ratio. Exploring other options to maintain a balanced approach.

Balancing the crew

OK, let me see. I’m thinking through sending 1M,1C to keep ratios in check. Then, returning 1M ensures balancing and avoids any issues with the constraints.

Balancing the crew

Sending 1M alone to bank2 seems feasible, keeping the missionary-cannibal ratio balanced. This move avoids rule violations on both banks, ensuring progress in a controlled manner.

Revealing the deadlock

I’m beginning to realize that with the constraints provided, there's no viable solution to the puzzle. The inability to transport two cannibals together without missionaries leads to a deadlock.

Reimagining cannibal constraints

OK, let me see. Considering if two cannibals alone on the boat work without missionaries, despite this potentially leading to a deadlock. медиум

Assessing valid boat choices

I’m gathering info on valid boat configurations like 1M, 2M, or 1M1C. Starting with 2M or 1M alone isn't feasible due to constraints.

Assessing feasibility

I’ve determined that the missionaries and cannibals puzzle with the given constraints is unsolvable. The extra boat rule severely limits valid moves, making a solution unattainable.

Reflecting on constraints

Considering that the boat's rule might render the puzzle unsolvable by imposing severe limitations on valid moves. This leads me to think the results hinge on the puzzle's constraints.

Mapping the strategy

Starting with 1M and 1C ensures the safe crossing, leading to states where the constraints are met. Returning with 1M is crucial to continue safely.

Spotting the loop

Stopped at an infinite loop with no way to advance constraints. Realizing no solution exists with given parameters and constraints.

Clarifying assumptions

OK, let me see. Without missionaries, cannibals might not outnumber anyone. The rules often address this, so it's crucial to ensure cannibals can't outnumber missionaries on the boat.

Breaking down the logic

Enumerating valid moves, maintaining constraints, and recognizing patterns for a solution. Still pondering the puzzle's constraints and potential resolution.

Adjusting the strategy

I’m noting a strategic approach for the 3,3 scenario, focusing on moving cannibals and missionaries while respecting constraints. For 4,4, this method is modified to fit the larger puzzle.

Mapping the sequence

I’m detailing the steps for the 4,4 puzzle: moving pairs of cannibals, ensuring the boat's capacity, and preventing missionaries from being outnumbered on either bank.

Interpreting constraints

Wondering if the puzzle's ambiguity is key. Assuming 0 missionaries is harmless, the puzzle becomes solvable, with a known solution in 11 to 15 moves for 4,4.

Ensuring progress

I’m making sure the boat adheres to constraints, balancing missionaries and cannibals on both banks. Each step checks side states to maintain valid moves.

Balancing options

Reevaluating decision trees for valid moves with 4,4 constraints. Considering reciprocal moves and valid sequences to navigate back to symmetrical constraints. Progress is steady and methodical.

Testing routes

Interestingly enough, I’m trying a valid sequence for 4,4. Moving 2 cannibals first, returning 1 cannibal, then moving 2 missionaries. But revisiting earlier steps isn't effective.

Evaluating transitional methods

I'm looking into tweaking the standard approach by analyzing sequences and ensuring constraints remain intact. Progress is steady and methodical, though no conclusive solution emerges yet.

Piecing together

I’m curious about the puzzle constraints, particularly the ambiguous boat rule. This makes me wonder if the problem is unsolvable or just a bit stumped.

Piecing it together

OK, let me see. Interpreting the boat constraint as relaxed leads to a solvable puzzle, with rules for the boat being the same as other locations.

Mapping out a strategy

I’m piecing together a solution for 4,4. Considering optimal moves and valid crossing sequences to meet constraints while efficiently progressing towards the puzzle's objectives.

Piecing together the solution

I’m pulling together a sequence for the 4,4 puzzle, ensuring each move adheres to the constraints and progressing towards a valid solution.

Ensuring compliance

Returning 1M or 1C breaks rules. I’m thinking through using 2M or 2C to avoid this and keep progressing towards the solution.

Assessing the outcome

Thinking through the puzzle constraints, starting with 2M or 1M alone isn't an option. This suggests that solving the 4,4 case with the given rules and constraints might be impossible.

Analysis

This puzzle is a twist on the classic “Missionaries and Cannibals” problem. In the usual (3,3) version with a boat of capacity 2, one can find a solution under the rule:

On either bank, if there are any missionaries present, they cannot be outnumbered by cannibals.

Often the boat itself is not treated as a separate “location” where that same outnumbering rule applies strictly. Instead, one typically ignores the composition on the boat for the few minutes it is in transit.

However, this puzzle adds the extra rule:

“Also, the cannibals may never outnumber the missionaries on the boat or the missionaries will be eaten.”

Depending on how one interprets “outnumber” when there are 
0
0 missionaries on the boat, one of two things can happen:

Strict interpretation:
If 
𝑀
=
0
M=0 on the boat and 
𝐶
>
0
C>0, then cannibals outnumber missionaries (since 
0
<
𝐶
0<C), hence that is forbidden.

Under this strict reading, you can never put a cannibal on the boat without having at least an equal number of missionaries also on the boat.
Because the boat holds at most 2 people, one quickly sees that the only valid boat-loads are
1 missionary alone 
(
1
𝑀
,
0
𝐶
)
(1M,0C),
2 missionaries 
(
2
𝑀
,
0
𝐶
)
(2M,0C),
1 missionary + 1 cannibal 
(
1
𝑀
,
1
𝐶
)
(1M,1C).
As soon as you try these boat loads with 4 missionaries and 4 cannibals, you get stuck immediately. In fact, one can do a short search and see there is no way to shuttle all 
4
𝑀
4M and 
4
𝐶
4C across while keeping both banks safe.
Conclusion: Under strict reading (no boat trip is ever allowed to have 
𝐶
>
𝑀
C>M, even if 
𝑀
=
0
M=0), there is no solution for 
4
𝑀
,
4
𝐶
4M,4C.
Looser (classic) interpretation:
If 
𝑀
=
0
M=0 on the boat, there are no missionaries to be eaten, so that boat-load is “safe.” In other words, cannibals only “outnumber” missionaries if there is at least one missionary present.

Under this looser reading, sending 
2
𝐶
2C alone on the boat (with 
0
𝑀
0M) is perfectly fine.
That reverts this puzzle back to the usual “missionaries ≥ cannibals on each bank (unless 
𝑀
=
0
M=0 there).”
For 
(
3
,
3
)
(3,3), there is a well-known solution. However, for 
(
4
,
4
)
(4,4) and a boat of capacity 2, it is a known (though nontrivial) fact that no safe sequence of crossings exists.
One can attempt the usual patterns (e.g., sending 2 cannibals, returning 1, sending 2 again, etc.), but you eventually get stuck with one bank having more cannibals than missionaries.
Indeed, for 
𝑛
=
4
n=4 and boat-capacity 
2
2, the puzzle is famously unsolvable under the “missionaries ≥ cannibals on every bank” rule.
Therefore—no matter which way you interpret “outnumber” on the boat—the 
(
4
𝑀
,
4
𝐶
)
(4M,4C) problem with a 2-person boat cannot be solved so that everyone ends up on the far side without ever violating the safety rules.

Short Reasoning Why It Fails
If you forbid 2 cannibals alone on the boat (because 
0
𝑀
<
2
𝐶
0M<2C):

Then all boat trips must have at least as many 
𝑀
M as 
𝐶
C on board.
From the very start, you cannot even send 2 missionaries (leaving 
2
𝑀
,
4
𝐶
2M,4C behind, which breaks the bank rule), nor 1 missionary (leaving 
3
𝑀
,
4
𝐶
3M,4C behind), nor 2 cannibals, nor 1 cannibal alone.
The only first trip that doesn’t break the bank is 
(
1
𝑀
,
1
𝐶
)
(1M,1C). But if you work through the subsequent moves carefully, you get stuck in loops or contradictions.
If you allow 2 cannibals alone on the boat (because “no missionaries present” means “no one can get eaten”):

Then the puzzle reverts to the “classic” constraint on the banks only.
The known result is that 
(
3
𝑀
,
3
𝐶
)
(3M,3C) is solvable with a 2-person boat, but 
(
4
𝑀
,
4
𝐶
)
(4M,4C) is not solvable. (One can do a systematic search or consult known analyses showing that for boat capacity 2, going beyond 
(
3
,
3
)
(3,3) fails.)
Either way, the end result is:

There is no plan that safely transports all 4 missionaries and all 4 cannibals to the other side under these rules.

Final Answer
No solution exists. The puzzle, as stated (4 missionaries, 4 cannibals, boat of size 2, and no outnumbering allowed on either bank or on the boat), is unsolvable.
