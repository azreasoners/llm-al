Thought about missionaries and cannibals puzzle for 25 seconds
Analyzing constraints

Hm, that's interesting. The problem involves four missionaries and four cannibals crossing a river with a boat for two. The boat can't cross without passengers, and cannibals can't outnumber missionaries on either bank, including the boat.

Weighing possibilities

OK, let me see. With two cannibals, they outnumber missionaries. But without missionaries, there’s no risk. The rule generally holds except when missionaries are absent.

Navigating the rule

OK, let's break this down: with 0 missionaries, cannibals can't outnumber missionaries. Since missionaries aren't in the boat, the rule can't be violated if cannibals are present.

Considering the challenge

Now I’m thinking about the classic missionary-cannibal puzzle. With four missionaries and four cannibals, and a boat capacity of two, it seems unsolvable.

Assessing the issue

The 4,4 puzzle can't be solved with a boat capacity of 2. Interestingly enough, the 3,3 puzzle is the maximum solvable scenario.

Evaluating constraints

OK, let me see. The "Missionaries and Cannibals" puzzle with four missionaries and four cannibals and a boat capacity of 2 is widely known to be unsolvable.

Navigating constraints

OK, let's figure this out. Constraints like "cannibals on the boat" might reduce possible moves, making the puzzle unsolvable even if only combining the two constraints.

Validating constraints

OK, let me see. With a boat capacity of 2, four missionaries and four cannibals aren't solvable. The initial state and allowed moves confirm this.

Evaluating strategies

Sending one missionary and one cannibal is safe, but returning the boat with a cannibal isn't possible. Repetition in moves confirms constraints like sending two missionaries are unsafe.

Mapping out a solution

I’m working through strategies to move all missionaries and cannibals to bank2 without safety issues. Adjustments like combining trips with missionaries and cannibals might help.

Evaluating safety

Considering sending one missionary and one cannibal together might work. Shipwreck scenarios could indicate potential issues, though the risk seems minimal.

Testing various strategies

I’m trying different methods, like sending missionaries first, to see if the boat can return safely with cannibals. These experiments indicate the levels 3 and 3 are safe.

Analyzing constraints

It's becoming clear that the puzzle is unsolvable with the given constraints. For M=3 and boat capacity of 2, the problem works, but beyond that, it's impossible.

Assessing possibilities

After reflecting on the puzzle's constraints, it’s clear that with 4 missionaries and 4 cannibals, boat capacity of 2, and preventing cannibals outnumbering missionaries, no solution is possible.

Analyzing constraints

I'm rethinking the boat's rule—if no missionaries are present, cannibals can't outnumber them. This limitation might allow for a solution by altering the puzzle's dynamics.

Navigating the limitations

I’m noting that the boat can only carry one or two missionaries at a time, making the puzzle tricky if more cannibals and missionaries need to be transported.

Simulating allowed moves

OK, let me see. The boat can only carry one or two missionaries at a time. This keeps cannibals from outnumbering missionaries, ensuring a safe transfer.

Clarifying safety rules

If missionaries are present, cannibals can't outnumber them. If no missionaries are present, any number of cannibals is safe. The boat can carry at most two cannibals at once.

Mapping potential paths

With 2 cannibals on the boat, only 1 or 2 cannibals can return, risking the initial safe state. This makes me reconsider the allowed moves and their implications.

Trying another way

I’m exploring different moves, like sending 1 cannibal or 1 missionary with 1 cannibal. The goal is to keep missionaries safe, avoiding any unsafe states.

Weighing safe options

Sending 1 missionary involves careful coordination to avoid unsafe states, like leaving too few missionaries on one bank when cannibals are present. This requires mindfulness.

We will show that under the given rules no solution exists.

In this “missionaries and cannibals” puzzle the rules are as follows:

There are 4 missionaries and 4 cannibals on bank1, and the goal is to get everyone safely to bank2.
A boat (the “vessel”) is available that can carry at most 2 people (an “integer” number of individuals) per trip and it cannot cross empty.
On either bank (the “locations”) the “group” of missionaries present must never be outnumbered by the cannibals (unless there are no missionaries there), or else the missionaries will be eaten.
In addition, during any crossing the people in the boat (also a “group”) must be arranged so that if any missionaries are aboard they are not outnumbered by the cannibals.
It is a well‐known fact about this class of puzzles that when the boat’s capacity is 2 the problem is solvable only when there are 3 or fewer missionaries and cannibals. In the case of 4 and 4, no matter what moves one tries there is always a point at which on one bank (or on the boat, if it carries at least one missionary) the cannibals would outnumber the missionaries. (Any move that avoids that on the departing bank then forces a dangerous situation on the receiving bank, and vice‐versa.)

For example, one might try to begin by sending two cannibals to bank2. Then the state would be:

bank1: 4 missionaries, 2 cannibals
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals
boat: at bank2
However, when bringing the boat back the only available moves (e.g. returning one cannibal) leave bank1 with 4 missionaries and 3 cannibals. From there, any attempt to transport a pair (whether 2 cannibals, 1 missionary and 1 cannibal, or 2 missionaries) eventually forces one bank into a state where the missionaries are outnumbered. One may check all possibilities and find that every sequence eventually leads to a violation of the safety condition on one side or the other.

Because of this unavoidable “trap” in the state–space, it is proven that no sequence of valid moves exists that would safely transfer all 4 missionaries and all 4 cannibals from bank1 to bank2 with a boat that can carry at most 2 people.

Thus, no plan exists to achieve the goal under the stated constraints.
