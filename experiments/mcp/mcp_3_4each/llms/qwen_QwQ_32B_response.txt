So I've got this problem here about four missionaries and four cannibals who need to cross a river using a boat that can carry at most two people at a time. There are a bunch of constraints to make sure that the cannibals never outnumber the missionaries in any location, otherwise, the missionaries might get eaten. Also, the boat can't cross the river with nothing on it, and on the boat itself, cannibals can't outnumber missionaries. It sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step.

First, let me understand the initial setup. We have bank1 and bank2, with bank1 being where everyone starts, and bank2 is the destination. The boat is initially at bank1. There are four missionaries (let's call them M) and four cannibals (let's call them C) all starting at bank1.

The goal is to get all of them to bank2 safely, following the rules:

1. Cannibals can't outnumber missionaries on either bank or on the boat.

2. The boat can't cross the river empty.

3. The boat can carry at most two people at a time.

Let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a classic river-crossing problem, similar to the missionaries and cannibals problem, but with equal numbers on both sides.

I should probably keep track of how many missionaries and cannibals are on each bank and on the boat at each step. Maybe I can use some notation to represent the state, like (M_bank1, C_bank1, boat_position, M_bank2, C_bank2).

Starting state: (4, 4, bank1, 0, 0)

And the goal state is: (0, 0, bank2, 4, 4)

I need to find a sequence of valid moves that gets me from the starting state to the goal state, following the rules.

Let's consider the possible moves. Since the boat can carry at most two people, the possible combinations are:

- Two missionaries (MM)

- Two cannibals (CC)

- One missionary and one cannibal (MC)

- One missionary (M)

- One cannibal (C)

But, there are constraints based on the numbers of missionaries and cannibals.

First, let's think about the first move. The boat is at bank1, and we need to send some people across to bank2.

Option 1: Send two missionaries (MM) from bank1 to bank2.

After this move:

- bank1: 2 M, 4 C

- boat: crossing to bank2

- bank2: 2 M, 0 C

But, I need to make sure that neither bank has cannibals outnumbering missionaries. After sending two missionaries to bank2:

- bank1: 2 M and 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

So, this option is not allowed.

Option 2: Send two cannibals (CC) from bank1 to bank2.

After this move:

- bank1: 4 M, 2 C

- boat: crossing to bank2

- bank2: 0 M, 2 C

Again, at bank2, there are 0 M and 2 C, which means C > M, violating the rule.

So, this option is also not allowed.

Option 3: Send one missionary and one cannibal (MC) from bank1 to bank2.

After this move:

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

- boat: crossing to bank2

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

Here, both banks have M = C, so neither violates the rule.

This seems acceptable.

Option 4: Send one missionary (M) from bank1 to bank2.

After this move:

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

So, not allowed.

Option 5: Send one cannibal (C) from bank1 to bank2.

After this move:

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

- boat: crossing to bank2

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

At bank2, 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

So, not allowed.

From the above, the only acceptable first move is to send one missionary and one cannibal (MC) to bank2.

So, first move: MC from bank1 to bank2.

State after first move:

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

- boat: at bank2 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

Now, from bank2, someone needs to go back to bank1, since the boat can't cross empty.

Possible return trips:

- Send MM back (but there's only 1 M at bank2)

- Send CC back (only 1 C at bank2)

- Send MC back (1 M and 1 C)

- Send M back (1 M)

- Send C back (1 C)

Given that there's only 1 M and 1 C at bank2, the possible returns are:

- Send M back

- Send C back

- Send MC back (but that would leave bank2 with no one, which might not be useful)

Let's consider sending M back.

After sending M back:

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

Wait, bank2 has 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

So, sending M back is not allowed.

Option: Send C back.

After sending C back:

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 C

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C

At bank1: 3 M and 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

So, not allowed.

Option: Send MC back.

After sending MC back:

- bank2: 0 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank1: 4 M, 4 C

Here, bank1 has 4 M and 4 C, which is M ≤ C, but the rule says cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries, so M ≤ C is allowed only if M ≠ 0. Since M = 4 > 0, it's fine.

So, sending MC back seems acceptable.

State after sending MC back:

- bank1: 4 M, 4 C

- boat: at bank1 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank2: 0 M, 0 C

Wait, this is back to the starting state. That's not helpful; we need to make progress.

Maybe sending MC back isn't the best move. Let's think differently.

Perhaps, after the first move of sending MC to bank2, instead of sending MC back, consider that the boat can carry at most two people, and we need to ensure that the rules are followed.

Wait, perhaps I need to send only one person back to make room for others.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the boat can carry at most two people, but sometimes it's useful to send one person back.

But in this case, sending MC back to bank1 doesn't help because it brings us back to the starting state.

Let me try a different approach.

Alternative first move: Instead of sending MC to bank2, maybe send two cannibals (CC) to bank2, but earlier I saw that it leads to C > M at bank2.

Alternatively, send two missionaries (MM) to bank2, but that leads to C > M at bank1.

Hmm.

Another idea: send one cannibal and one missionary (MC) to bank2, as I did before, but then figure out a different return trip.

Wait, perhaps after sending MC to bank2, instead of sending MC back, send only the cannibal back.

Let's try that.

First move: MC to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

- boat: at bank2 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

Now, send C back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 C

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C

At bank1: 3 M and 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

So, not allowed.

Alternative: Send M back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

At bank2: 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

So, not allowed.

It seems like sending either M or C back individually also causes problems.

Maybe I need to think about sending different combinations.

Alternative approach: Start by sending two cannibals (CC) to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 4 M, 2 C

- boat: crossing to bank2 with 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 2 C

At bank2: 0 M and 2 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

So, not allowed.

Alternative: Send one cannibal (C) to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

- boat: crossing to bank2 with 1 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

At bank2: 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

So, not allowed.

Alternative: Send one missionary (M) to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

So, not allowed.

Alternative: Send two missionaries (MM) to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 2 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

So, not allowed.

It seems like the only acceptable first move is to send MC to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

- boat: at bank2 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

Now, to make progress, perhaps from bank2, send C back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 C

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

So, not allowed.

Alternative: From bank2, send M back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

At bank2: 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

So, not allowed.

Hmm, this is tricky.

Maybe I need to send MC back to bank1 again, but that just brings me back to the starting state.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to send more people in the first trip.

Wait, the boat can carry at most two people, so I can't send more than two at a time.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I need to send two cannibals (CC) to bank2, even though it causes C > M at bank2, but perhaps there's a way to immediately balance it by sending someone back.

But, as I saw earlier, sending CC to bank2 leads to bank2 having 0 M and 2 C, which violates the rule.

Alternatively, perhaps sending two missionaries (MM) to bank2, even though it causes C > M at bank1, but again, that's not allowed.

I need to find a sequence where I can send people across without violating the rules at any step.

Maybe I need to consider sending different combinations.

Alternative idea: Send one missionary and one cannibal (MC) to bank2, then from bank2, send the cannibal back to bank1.

State after first move:

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

- boat: at bank2 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

Now, send C back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 C

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Alternative: From bank2, send M back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

At bank2: 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Wait, perhaps I need to send both M and C back to bank1, but that just undoes the first move.

Alternatively, maybe I need to send only the missionary back.

Wait, but that leads to the earlier problem.

Let me think about it differently.

Perhaps I need to send two cannibals (CC) to bank2, then immediately send one cannibal back, but as we've seen, sending CC to bank2 violates the rule at bank2.

Alternative approach: Maybe I need to send one missionary and two cannibals, but the boat can only carry two people, so that would be MC, but that's only two people.

Wait, the boat can carry at most two people, so I can't send MC and another C.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider multiple trips in a specific sequence.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a general strategy for these kinds of problems.

I recall that in similar problems, it's often useful to have someone shuttle back and forth to balance the numbers.

Perhaps I need to establish a pattern where I send some people across and then bring back others to maintain the balance.

Let me try another sequence.

First, send MC to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

- boat: at bank2 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

Now, from bank2, send C back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 C

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Alternative: From bank2, send M back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

At bank2: 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to send MC back to bank1, but that just undoes the first move.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to send only the cannibal back, but that leads to C > M at bank1.

Wait, maybe I need to send the missionary back instead.

But that leads to 0 M at bank2 with 1 C, which violates the rule.

This seems like a dead end.

Perhaps I need to consider sending different combinations.

Alternative first move: Send two cannibals (CC) to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 4 M, 2 C

- boat: crossing to bank2 with 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 2 C

At bank2: 0 M and 2 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Alternative: Send one cannibal (C) to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

- boat: crossing to bank2 with 1 C

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

At bank2: 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Alternative: Send one missionary (M) to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Alternative: Send two missionaries (MM) to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 2 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

It seems like the only acceptable first move is to send MC to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

- boat: at bank2 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

Now, from bank2, I need to send someone back to bank1, but both options (sending M or C back) lead to violating the rules.

Wait, maybe I need to send both M and C back to bank1, but that just undoes the first move.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to send only the cannibal back.

State:

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 C

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Alternatively, send only the missionary back.

State:

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

At bank2: 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

This seems like a deadlock. Maybe I need to consider a different first move.

Wait, perhaps I can send two missionaries (MM) to bank2, accepting that bank1 will have C > M, and then quickly balance it by sending someone back.

But, as per the rules, that's not allowed because bank1 would have C > M.

Alternatively, maybe I can send two cannibals (CC) to bank2, accepting that bank2 will have C > M, and then balance it by sending someone back.

But again, that violates the rule at bank2.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to allow temporary violations under certain conditions, but the problem states that the rules must be followed at all times.

Perhaps there's no solution in this scenario.

Wait, but intuitively, there should be a way to get everyone across safely.

Let me try to think outside the box.

Is there a way to have people cross in a way that maintains the required balances at all steps?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the boat to have cannibals outnumbering missionaries only when it's in transit, but the problem states that on the boat, cannibals may never outnumber missionaries, or the missionaries will be eaten.

So, on the boat, cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries.

Given that, I need to ensure that in any crossing, the number of cannibals does not exceed the number of missionaries on the boat.

Given the boat's capacity of two, the acceptable combinations are:

- Two missionaries (MM)

- One missionary and one cannibal (MC)

- One missionary (M)

- One cannibal (C), but only if there's at least one missionary on the boat, which isn't possible since the boat can only carry two people and I'd need at least one missionary to balance the cannibal.

Wait, actually, if I send one cannibal (C), I'd need at least one missionary to accompany them to ensure that on the boat, M ≥ C.

So, sending a single cannibal is not allowed because it would have C > M on the boat.

Therefore, the only acceptable single person to send is a missionary.

But, as we've seen, sending a single missionary back can lead to problems.

Given that, perhaps the only acceptable moves are sending MM or MC to the other side, ensuring that the rules are not violated.

Given that, perhaps I need to accept that the first move must be MC to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

- boat: at bank2 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

Now, from bank2, I need to send someone back to bank1.

Given that, perhaps I need to send the cannibal back.

State:

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 C

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Alternatively, send the missionary back.

State:

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

At bank2: 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

It seems like sending either M or C back individually causes problems.

Alternative: Send both M and C back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 0 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank1: 4 M, 4 C

This just brings us back to the starting state.

Not helpful.

Wait, maybe I need to send MC to bank2 again.

State:

- bank1: 2 M, 2 C

- boat: at bank2 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank2: 2 M, 2 C

Now, from bank2, I need to send someone back to bank1.

If I send C back:

- bank2: 2 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 C

- bank1: 2 M, 3 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

If I send M back:

- bank2: 1 M, 2 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M

- bank1: 3 M, 2 C

At bank2: 1 M and 2 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Alternatively, send MC back:

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

Now, from bank1, I can send MC to bank2 again.

State:

- bank1: 2 M, 2 C

- boat: at bank2 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank2: 2 M, 2 C

This seems similar to the previous state.

It appears that I'm going in circles.

Maybe I need to try a different initial approach.

Alternative plan: Start by sending two missionaries (MM) to bank2, accepting that bank1 will have C > M, but perhaps find a way to quickly balance it.

First move: Send MM to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 2 M, 4 C

- boat: at bank2 with 2 M

- bank2: 2 M, 0 C

At bank1: 2 M and 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

So, not allowed.

Alternative: Send two cannibals (CC) to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 4 M, 2 C

- boat: at bank2 with 2 C

- bank2: 0 M, 2 C

At bank2: 0 M and 2 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Alternative: Send one missionary and one cannibal (MC) to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

- boat: at bank2 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

Then, from bank2, send C back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 C

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Alternative: From bank2, send M back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

At bank2: 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the boat can carry two people, so perhaps from bank2, I can send someone back with the boat.

But in this state, bank2 has only 1 C, so I can only send C back, which leads to C > M at bank1.

Not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to send MC back, but that would require sending M from bank2, which only has C.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

This seems really challenging. Maybe I need to consider that it's impossible to get all missionaries and cannibals across under these constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a flaw in my reasoning.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I send MC to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

- boat: at bank2 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

Now, from bank2, perhaps I can send C back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 C

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Alternatively, from bank2, send M back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

At bank2: 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Wait, maybe I need to send C back first, accept that bank1 has C > M, and then quickly balance it by sending someone else.

But, the rules don't allow temporary violations, so that's not acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to send MC back to bank1, which would bring me back to the starting state, but that doesn't help.

This seems like a dead end.

Maybe I need to consider sending different numbers or combinations.

Wait, perhaps I can send two missionaries (MM) to bank2, accepting that bank1 will have C > M, and then immediately send one missionary back, but that still leaves bank1 with C > M.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, send MC to bank2, then from bank2, send C back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 C

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Alternatively, send M back from bank2 to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

At bank2: 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the boat can carry two people, so perhaps from bank2, I can send C and M back together.

But, bank2 only has 1 C, no M.

Wait, bank2 has 0 M and 1 C after sending M back.

So, that's not possible.

This seems really problematic.

Perhaps I need to consider that it's impossible to get all across under these constraints.

Alternatively, maybe I need to allow for more complex sequences of moves.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I send MC to bank2.

State:

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

- boat: at bank2 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

Now, from bank2, perhaps I can send C back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 C

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Alternatively, send M back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

At bank2: 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the boat can carry two people, so perhaps from bank2, I can send C and M back together.

But, bank2 only has 1 C and no M.

Wait, that's not possible.

This seems like a stalemate.

Perhaps I need to consider that it's impossible to get all across under these constraints.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the boat can carry two people, and perhaps sometimes it's okay to have C > M temporarily, but the problem strictly says that cannibals may never outnumber missionaries on either bank or on the boat.

Given that, I need to find a sequence where at no point do cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank or on the boat.

Given the constraints, it seems really difficult, if not impossible, to get all across safely.

Maybe the problem has no solution under these constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the boat can carry two people, and sometimes it's necessary to have a cannibal on the boat with a missionary.

But, according to the rules, on the boat, cannibals may never outnumber missionaries.

So, on the boat, if there's one cannibal, there must be at least one missionary.

Similarly, if there are two cannibals, there must be at least two missionaries, but since the boat can only carry two people, that's not possible.

Therefore, the only acceptable combinations are:

- Two missionaries (MM)

- One missionary and one cannibal (MC)

- One missionary (M)

- One cannibal (C), but only if there's at least one missionary on the boat, which isn't possible since the boat can only carry two people.

Therefore, the only acceptable single person to send is a missionary.

Given that, perhaps I need to accept that the only way is to send MC to bank2, then from bank2, send C back to bank1, accepting that bank1 will have C > M, but perhaps find a way to balance it immediately.

But, as we've seen, that leads to violations.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to send MC to bank2, then from bank2, send M back to bank1.

State:

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

At bank2: 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

Wait, maybe I need to think about sending different numbers of people in different trips.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to accept that it's impossible under these constraints.

Given the constraints, it seems that no matter what I try, I end up with a violation at some step.

Therefore, perhaps the conclusion is that it's impossible to get all missionaries and cannibals across the river under these rules.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a crucial step or sequence that could make it work.

Let me try to look for a general strategy.

In standard missionary and cannibal problems, the key is to carefully manage the numbers to prevent cannibals from outnumbering missionaries.

However, in those problems, the numbers are usually three of each, and solutions exist.

In this case, with four of each, perhaps the solution is different, or perhaps it's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the constraint that the boat cannot cross with nothing on it isn't relevant here, but it's still a constraint we have to follow.

Wait, in this problem, the boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it, but in standard problems, sometimes the boat can cross empty.

Here, it cannot, which might further complicate things.

Given that, perhaps it's impossible to get all across safely.

Alternatively, maybe there's a multi-step sequence that I'm not seeing.

Let me try to outline a possible sequence:

1. Send MC to bank2.

- bank1: 3 M, 3 C

- boat: at bank2 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank2: 1 M, 1 C

2. From bank2, send C back to bank1.

- bank2: 1 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 C

- bank1: 3 M, 4 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

3. Alternatively, from bank2, send M back to bank1.

- bank2: 0 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M

- bank1: 4 M, 3 C

At bank2: 0 M and 1 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

4. Send MC back to bank1.

- bank2: 0 M, 0 C

- boat: crossing to bank1 with 1 M and 1 C

- bank1: 4 M, 4 C

This brings us back to the starting state.

Not helpful.

5. Send MM to bank2.

- bank1: 2 M, 3 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

6. Send CC to bank2.

- bank1: 3 M, 1 C

- boat: crossing to bank2 with 2 C

- bank2: 1 M, 3 C → C > M, which violates the rule.

Not allowed.

It seems like every path I take leads to a violation of the rules.

Therefore, I conclude that it's impossible to get all four missionaries and four cannibals across the river to bank2 under the given constraints.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{It is impossible to transport all four missionaries and four cannibals from bank1 to bank2 under the given constraints.}} \]
