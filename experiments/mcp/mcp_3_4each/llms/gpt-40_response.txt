This problem is a classic river-crossing puzzle that can be solved using state-space search. Here is a structured approach:

Definitions and Constraints:
Initial State:

4 missionaries, 4 cannibals, and the boat are at bank1.
bank2 is empty.
Goal State:

All 4 missionaries and 4 cannibals are at bank2.
Rules:

The boat can carry 1 or 2 people.
The boat cannot cross empty.
Cannibals must never outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
State Representation:
Each state can be represented as a tuple:

(
𝑀
1
,
𝐶
1
,
𝐵
,
𝑀
2
,
𝐶
2
)
(M 
1
​
 ,C 
1
​
 ,B,M 
2
​
 ,C 
2
​
 )
where:

𝑀
1
M 
1
​
  and 
𝐶
1
C 
1
​
 : Number of missionaries and cannibals on bank1.
𝑀
2
M 
2
​
  and 
𝐶
2
C 
2
​
 : Number of missionaries and cannibals on bank2.
𝐵
B: Location of the boat (0 for bank1, 1 for bank2).
Algorithm:
Initial State: (4, 4, 0, 0, 0)

Goal State: (0, 0, 1, 4, 4)

Valid Moves: The boat can carry:

1 missionary (1M).
1 cannibal (1C).
2 missionaries (2M).
2 cannibals (2C).
1 missionary and 1 cannibal (1M1C).
For each move, the resulting state must satisfy:

𝑀
1
≥
𝐶
1
M 
1
​
 ≥C 
1
​
  (if 
𝑀
1
>
0
M 
1
​
 >0).
𝑀
2
≥
𝐶
2
M 
2
​
 ≥C 
2
​
  (if 
𝑀
2
>
0
M 
2
​
 >0).
Search: Use breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible states. Track visited states to avoid cycles.

Example Plan:
A possible sequence of moves is:

1C, 1M → bank2.
1C ← bank1.
2C → bank2.
1C ← bank1.
2M → bank2.
1C, 1M ← bank1.
2M → bank2.
1C ← bank1.
2C → bank2.
1C ← bank1.
1C, 1M → bank2.
Would you like me to provide the detailed implementation of the algorithm or visualize the solution?
