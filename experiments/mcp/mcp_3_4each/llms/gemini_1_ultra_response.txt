Absolutely! Here's how we can approach the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem and provide a solution plan.

Understanding the Rules:

Capacity: The boat can carry a maximum of two people.
Safety: On either bank of the river, the cannibals cannot outnumber the missionaries, or the missionaries will be in danger.
Boat Operation: The boat cannot travel across the river empty.
Representing the Problem:

Let's use the following shorthand:

M: Missionaries
C: Cannibals
B: Boat
We'll represent the state of the problem like this:

(Number of Missionaries on Bank 1, Number of Cannibals on Bank 1, Boat Location)

Starting State: (4, 4, bank1)

Goal State: (0, 0, bank2)

Solution Plan

Here's a step-by-step solution to get everyone safely across the river:

(2, 4, bank1) -> (2, 2, bank2): Two cannibals cross to the other side.
(2, 3, bank2) -> (3, 3, bank1): One cannibal returns with the boat.
(3, 3, bank1) -> (1, 3, bank2): Two missionaries cross to the other side.
(2, 3, bank2) -> (2, 4, bank1): One cannibal returns with the boat.
(2, 4, bank1) -> (0, 4, bank2): Two cannibals cross to the other side.
(0, 3, bank2) -> (1, 3, bank1): One cannibal returns with the boat.
(1, 3, bank1) -> (0, 1, bank2): Two missionaries cross to the other side.
(0, 2, bank2) -> (0, 3, bank1): One cannibal returns with the boat.
(0, 3, bank1) -> (0, 0, bank2): Two cannibals cross to the other side.
Key Points

We must always ensure safety on both banks.
Sometimes, it's necessary to move backward temporarily to reach the final solution.
