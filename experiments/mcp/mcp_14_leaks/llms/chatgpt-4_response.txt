The problem you described is a classic puzzle known as the "Missionaries and Cannibals" problem, which involves careful planning to ensure the missionaries are never outnumbered by the cannibals either on the banks or in the boat. Here's a step-by-step solution that adheres to the constraints you've provided:

Initial Setup:
Location bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, 1 boat
Location bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals, 0 boat
Cross the River:
Ensure at each step the missionaries are not outnumbered by the cannibals on either bank or in the boat.
Keep in mind the boat must always have someone rowing it and, if it has two people, someone to bail water as well.
Here's a plan:

Move 1: Two cannibals row and bail from bank1 to bank2.
bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal, 0 boat
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals, 1 boat
Move 2: One cannibal rows back from bank2 to bank1.
bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals, 1 boat
bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal, 0 boat
Move 3: Two cannibals row and bail from bank1 to bank2.
bank1: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals, 0 boat
bank2: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals, 1 boat
Move 4: One cannibal rows back from bank2 to bank1.
bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal, 1 boat
bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals, 0 boat
Move 5: Two missionaries row and bail from bank1 to bank2.
bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal, 0 boat
bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals, 1 boat
Move 6: One missionary and one cannibal row back from bank2 to bank1.
bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals, 1 boat
bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal, 0 boat
Move 7: Two missionaries row and bail from bank1 to bank2.
bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals, 0 boat
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal, 1 boat
Move 8: One cannibal rows back from bank2 to bank1.
bank1: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals, 1 boat
bank2: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals, 0 boat
Move 9: Two cannibals row and bail from bank1 to bank2.
bank1: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal, 0 boat
bank2: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals, 1 boat
Move 10: One cannibal rows back from bank2 to bank1.
bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals, 1 boat
bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal, 0 boat
Move 11: Two cannibals row and bail from bank1 to bank2.
bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals, 0 boat
bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, 1 boat
This sequence of moves ensures that the missionaries are never outnumbered by the cannibals on either bank or on the boat at any point in the process, meeting all the requirements of the puzzle and solving it successfully.
