Mapping the challenge

I’m figuring out how to get three missionaries and three cannibals across the river without outnumbering missionaries at any point. The boat carries at most two people and leaks when two are on board.

Formulating a strategy

I’m thinking through the constraints: the boat can carry 1 or 2 people, no empty crossings, and cannibals should never outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat.

Taking a closer look

Hm, that's interesting. With two aboard, one rows while the other bails. Alone, though, crossing seems tricky, as neither can manage both tasks.

Assessing the situation

OK, let me see. With two people in the boat crossing the leaky river, one rows while the other bails out water, as they can't do both tasks together.

Mapping out constraints

I'm laying out the rules: cannibals can't outnumber missionaries on either side. Starting with 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals, I want to ensure safe crossings without violating the constraints.

Evaluating potential strategies

I’m thinking through options for ferrying cannibals and missionaries, ensuring cannibals never outnumber missionaries. Mapping out each step to follow a safe sequence toward a solution.

Prioritizing cannabies

I start by moving two cannibals to bank 2, then bring one back, ensuring safety. Trying another way, I move two missionaries to bank 2 while monitoring cannibal and missionary dynamics.

Rearranging options

Considering different boat crossings to avoid missionaries being outnumbered by cannibals. Progressing through varying configurations to identify a suitable solution.

Evaluating carriage options

I first consider transporting two missionaries. However, the risk of cannibals overpowering missionaries makes this impossible. So, I opt for one missionary and one cannibal instead.

Ensuring balance

I’m working through ensuring cannibals don't outnumber missionaries on bank1. Sending the missionary back helped maintain balance. Now, I’m managing the boat to move two cannibals to bank2.

Balancing journey

I’m figuring out the balance between cannibals and missionaries. Sending one cannibal back keeps everyone safe on both banks. Then, two missionaries move to bank2, ensuring a peaceful transfer.

Weighing options

I'm thinking through the idea of one cannibal returning to bank1. This stalls progress, as cannibals outnumber missionaries, making it an unacceptable solution.

Crafting a solution

After testing various moves, I found that having one missionary and one cannibal return to bank1 ensures no cannibals outnumber missionaries. This method effectively maintains balance.

Reassessing the strategy

I realize sending two cannibals to bank 2 causes an imbalance. Instead, I propose a new plan to balance their numbers.

Adjusting strategy

I’m considering different ways to transport two missionaries and two cannibals across the river, ensuring neither group outnumbers the other. It’s interesting to see the balance evolve gradually.

Mapping out scenarios

First, using two missionaries results in more cannibals than missionaries. Adjusting the strategy to one missionary and one cannibal led to an unacceptable imbalance.

Balancing the journey

I moved one missionary to bank1, then two cannibals to bank2. After checking ratios, I brought one cannibal back. Responsible progress continued with another two missionaries to bank2. Wrap it up by returning one missionary and one cannibal to bank1.

Balancing the journey

I’m navigating the left bank, ensuring missionaries don't outnumber cannibals. After the boat crosses to the right, I’m evaluating the numbers and planning subsequent moves.

Mapping the course

I’m guiding the boat with two cannibals to cross to bank2. After checking, no bank2 missionaries outnumber cannibals, confirming a safe solution.

Making progress

One cannibal returns to Bank1, and two missionaries cross to Bank2. Another missionary and cannibal return to Bank1, then two missionaries cross to Bank2. Finally, one cannibal returns to Bank1, and two cannibals cross to Bank2.

Examining boat dynamics

I'm working through the mechanics of a boat leak. With two occupants, one rows while the other bails. This setup ensures effective crossing.

To solve this problem, we need to transport all three missionaries and three cannibals from bank1 to bank2 using a boat that can carry at most two people. We must adhere to the following constraints:

The boat cannot cross the river empty.
Cannibals can never outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat.
If there are two people in the boat, one must row and one must bail water because the river leaks.
A single person cannot row and bail simultaneously.
Here is the step-by-step plan that ensures all constraints are met:

Initial State:

Bank1: 3 Missionaries (M), 3 Cannibals (C), Boat
Bank2: None
Move 1: One missionary and one cannibal cross to bank2.

Boat Crossing: M1 and C1
Bank1: 2M, 2C
Bank2: M1, C1
Reasoning: Both banks have equal numbers of missionaries and cannibals, so missionaries are safe. Two people are in the boat; one rows, one bails.

Move 2: The missionary returns to bank1.

Boat Crossing: M1
Bank1: 3M, 2C
Bank2: C1
Reasoning: The returning missionary ensures the boat is not empty. Both banks maintain safe numbers.

Move 3: Two cannibals cross to bank2.

Boat Crossing: C2 and C3
Bank1: 3M
Bank2: C1, C2, C3
Reasoning: No missionaries are on bank2, so cannibals can't outnumber them. Two cannibals can manage rowing and bailing.

Move 4: One cannibal returns to bank1.

Boat Crossing: C1
Bank1: 3M, C1
Bank2: C2, C3
Reasoning: This balances the cannibals on both banks, keeping missionaries safe.

Move 5: Two missionaries cross to bank2.

Boat Crossing: M1 and M2
Bank1: M3, C1
Bank2: M1, M2, C2, C3
Reasoning: Missionaries are now on bank2 to prevent cannibals from outnumbering them there.

Move 6: One missionary and one cannibal return to bank1.

Boat Crossing: M1 and C1
Bank1: M1, M3, C1
Bank2: M2, C2, C3
Reasoning: This brings back a missionary to prevent cannibals from outnumbering missionaries on bank1.

Move 7: Two missionaries cross to bank2.

Boat Crossing: M1 and M3
Bank1: C1
Bank2: M1, M2, M3, C2, C3
Reasoning: All missionaries are now on bank2.

Move 8: One cannibal returns to bank1.

Boat Crossing: C1
Bank1: C1
Bank2: M1, M2, M3, C2, C3
Reasoning: Prepares to bring the last cannibal over.

Move 9: The last cannibal crosses to bank2.

Boat Crossing: C1
Bank1: None
Bank2: M1, M2, M3, C1, C2, C3
Reasoning: All individuals are safely on bank2.

Final State:

Bank1: None
Bank2: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat
This plan ensures that at no point do cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank or in the boat. Additionally, the boat never crosses empty, and when two people are in the boat, one rows while the other bails water, satisfying the leaking river constraint.

Answer:

A plan that safely moves all missionaries and cannibals to bank2 while obeying the constraints is:

Missionary and cannibal cross to bank2.
Missionary returns to bank1.
Two cannibals cross to bank2.
One cannibal returns to bank1.
Two missionaries cross to bank2.
Missionary and cannibal return to bank1.
Two missionaries cross to bank2.
Cannibal returns to bank1.
Two cannibals cross to bank2.
At each step, cannibals never outnumber missionaries on any bank or in the boat, the boat is never empty, and when two are in the boat, one rows while the other bails.
