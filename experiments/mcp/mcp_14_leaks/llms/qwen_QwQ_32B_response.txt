So I've got this problem here about three missionaries and three cannibals who need to cross a river using a boat that can carry at most two people at a time. There are a bunch of constraints to make sure that the missionaries don't get eaten by the cannibals at any point. Let's see... I need to find a sequence of steps, or a plan, to get everyone from bank1 to bank2 safely.

First, I need to understand all the rules and constraints clearly:

1. The boat can carry at most two people at a time.

2. The boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it.

3. On either bank, cannibals may never outnumber missionaries; otherwise, the missionaries will be eaten.

4. Similarly, on the boat, cannibals may never outnumber missionaries; otherwise, the missionaries will be eaten.

5. The boat's capacity is two.

6. There's something about the river leaking if there are two people in the boat, but it seems like that's more about needing to bail water, and a single person can't row and bail simultaneously. But maybe that's just additional information and not a direct constraint for this problem.

Given that, I need to make sure that at no point are there more cannibals than missionaries on either bank or in the boat.

Let's start by defining the initial state:

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

My goal is to get to:

- Bank1: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Bank2: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

But I need to do this in steps, making sure that after each crossing, the constraints are satisfied.

Maybe I can think of this as a series of moves where in each move, one or two people cross the river, and I have to track the number of missionaries and cannibals on each bank and in the boat.

Let me try to outline a possible sequence:

1. Two people go from bank1 to bank2.

- But I need to choose who goes. If I send two missionaries, then bank1 would have 1 missionary and 3 cannibals, which violates the constraint because cannibals outnumber missionaries.

- Similarly, if I send two cannibals, then bank1 would have 3 missionaries and 1 cannibal, which is fine, but bank2 would have 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals, which is not allowed because cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries.

- So sending two cannibals is not an option.

- What if I send one missionary and one cannibal?

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

- This seems okay because on bank1, missionaries and cannibals are equal, and on bank2, they are also equal.

But wait, the boat is empty at bank2, and the boat cannot cross the river with nothing on it. So someone needs to bring the boat back to bank1.

So perhaps after the first crossing, one person should return with the boat to bank1.

Let's say, from bank2, one person returns to bank1.

- If a missionary returns, then bank2 would have 0 missionaries and 1 cannibal, which is not allowed.

- If a cannibal returns, then bank2 would have 1 missionary and 0 cannibals, which is allowed.

- So maybe the cannibal returns.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Hmm, but now on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries (3 cannibals and 2 missionaries), which violates the constraint.

This seems problematic. Maybe sending one missionary and one cannibal across first isn't the best move.

Let me try a different approach.

What if I send two missionaries across first?

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Again, the boat is empty at bank2, so someone needs to return.

If a missionary returns, then:

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Now, on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, if no one returns, but the boat cannot cross empty, so that's not an option.

This seems tricky. Maybe sending two missionaries across isn't the way to go either.

Let me consider sending one missionary and one cannibal across again, but think about what happens next more carefully.

First move:

- Send one missionary and one cannibal from bank1 to bank2.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Now, to avoid having the boat cross empty, someone needs to return to bank1 with the boat.

If the cannibal returns:

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

But again, on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

If the missionary returns:

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

This would leave bank2 with 0 missionaries and 1 cannibal, which is not allowed.

So neither option works.

Maybe I need to send two cannibals across first.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Now, if a cannibal returns:

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

This seems okay because on bank1, missionaries don't outnumber cannibals, and on bank2, cannibals don't outnumber missionaries since there's at least one missionary per cannibal, but there are 0 missionaries and 1 cannibal, which violates the constraint that cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries.

Wait, but if there are 0 missionaries and 1 cannibal, that means cannibals outnumber missionaries (since 1 > 0), which is not allowed.

So sending two cannibals across first also doesn't work.

This is confusing. Let me try to think differently.

Maybe I need to send one person across and have someone else return, but I need to ensure that the constraints are met at every step.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to send two people across, and have one return, but that might not be efficient.

Wait, maybe I can consider sending two people across, and then having one return, but carefully choosing who goes and who comes back.

Let's try this:

First move: send one missionary and one cannibal across.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Second move: have the cannibal return.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

But again, on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

Alternatively, have the missionary return.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

But then bank2 has 0 missionaries and 1 cannibal, which violates the constraint.

Hmm.

What if, instead of sending one of each across, I send two cannibals across first.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, have one cannibal return.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Now, send two missionaries across.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

But on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries (2 cannibals and 1 missionary), which is not allowed.

So that's no good.

Let me try another approach.

What if I send two missionaries across first.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, have one missionary return.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Again, on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

Alternatively, send one missionary and one cannibal back.

But that would leave bank2 with 0 missionaries and -1 cannibals, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. If I send one missionary and one cannibal back from bank2 to bank1, but bank2 only has 1 missionary and 0 cannibals, that's not possible.

So that's not an option.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to consider sending different combinations.

Let me try sending one cannibal across first.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, have the cannibal return.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

This brings us back to the starting state, which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, send one cannibal across, then send another cannibal across from bank1 to bank2.

- First send one cannibal across.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then send another cannibal across.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Now, send one cannibal back.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Now, send two missionaries across.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

But again, on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

This seems to be a recurring problem.

Maybe I need to send two missionaries and one cannibal across together, but the boat only holds two people, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to send one missionary and one cannibal across, then manage the returns carefully.

Let me try sending one missionary and one cannibal across.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, have the missionary return.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

But again, bank2 has 0 missionaries and 1 cannibal, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, have the cannibal return.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

And now, send two cannibals across.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Now, send one cannibal back.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Now, send one missionary and one cannibal across.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, send the cannibal back.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

But now, on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to consider sending different combinations.

Let me try starting over.

First move: send two cannibals across.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, send one cannibal back.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Now, send two missionaries across.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

But again, on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

Alternatively, send one missionary and one cannibal across.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Now, send the cannibal back.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Now, send two cannibals across.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 3 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

But on bank2, cannibals outnumber missionaries (3 cannibals and 1 missionary).

This violates the constraint.

This is frustrating. Maybe I need to consider sending one missionary and one cannibal across each time, but that seems to lead to loops.

Let me try sending two missionaries across first.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, have one missionary return.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

But again, on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

Alternatively, send one cannibal across to join the two missionaries on bank2.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, send one cannibal back.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 4 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

But now, bank1 has 1 missionary and 4 cannibals, which is not allowed.

This isn't working. Maybe I need to consider sending different numbers of people or managing the returns more carefully.

Wait a minute, perhaps I need to send two people across, and then have one person return, but ensure that the constraints are satisfied each time.

Let me try sending two cannibals across first.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, send one cannibal back.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Now, send two missionaries across.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

But again, on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

Alternatively, send one missionary and one cannibal across.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, send the cannibal back.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Now, send two cannibals across.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 3 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

But on bank2, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

This is not acceptable.

I need a different strategy.

Maybe I should consider that the boat can carry one or two people, so perhaps sending just one person across in some steps could be useful.

Let's try sending one cannibal across.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, send the cannibal back.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

This doesn't achieve much.

Alternatively, send one missionary across.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, send the missionary back.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Again, not helpful.

Perhaps I need to send one missionary and one cannibal across, then manage the returns carefully.

First move: send one missionary and one cannibal across.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Second move: send the cannibal back.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

But this leads to the same issue where on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

Alternatively, send the missionary back.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Now, send two cannibals across.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

But on bank2, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

This is not allowed.

This is really confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the only way to transport people without violating the constraints is to always have at least as many missionaries as cannibals on each bank and in the boat.

Given that, perhaps the only safe combinations are:

- Sending one missionary and one cannibal across together.

- Sending two missionaries across together.

- Sending two cannibals across together, but only if it doesn't lead to missionaries being outnumbered on either bank.

But from previous attempts, it seems like no matter what I do, I end up with a state where cannibals outnumber missionaries on one of the banks.

Is there a fundamental issue here? Maybe it's impossible to satisfy all the constraints.

Wait, but I know that the standard missionaries and cannibals problem is solvable, but in that version, the boat can carry up to two people, and the constraints are similar but perhaps not identical to this one.

In the standard problem, the boat can carry up to two people, and the constraint is that cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries on either bank, but in the boat, there is no such constraint.

However, in this problem, there is an additional constraint that on the boat, cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries, or the missionaries will be eaten.

Also, there's the issue with the boat leaking if there are two people in it, but I think that's more about needing to bail water, which might not be directly relevant to the constraints.

Given that, perhaps the standard solution to the missionaries and cannibals problem needs to be adjusted to account for the boat's constraints as well.

Let me recall the standard solution and see if it works here.

In the standard problem, a possible solution is:

1. Send one missionary and one cannibal across.

2. Have the cannibal return.

3. Send one missionary and one cannibal across again.

4. Have the missionary return.

5. Send two cannibals across.

6. Have one cannibal return.

7. Send two missionaries across.

8. Have one missionary and one cannibal return.

9. Send two cannibals across.

But I need to check if this satisfies all the constraints in this problem, including the boat's constraints.

Let's simulate this:

Start:

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Move 1: send one missionary and one cannibal across.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Move 2: cannibal returns.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

But on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries, which violates the constraint.

So this standard solution doesn't work here because it leads to a state where cannibals outnumber missionaries on bank1.

I need a different approach.

Maybe I need to ensure that after each move, the number of missionaries is at least the number of cannibals on both banks.

Given that, perhaps the only safe way is to always have an equal number of missionaries and cannibals on each bank, but that seems restrictive.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to accept that at some points, one bank may have zero missionaries and zero cannibals, as long as the other bank maintains the correct ratio.

But in practice, that's hard to manage.

Let me try another angle.

Suppose I try to minimize the number of times the constraints are at risk.

What if I send two cannibals across first.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Now, send one cannibal back.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Then, send two missionaries across.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

But again, on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

This seems unavoidable.

Alternatively, maybe I need to send one missionary and one cannibal across, then have the missionary return, and repeat this process.

But that doesn't make progress because each cycle would bring one missionary and one cannibal to bank2 and then back to bank1.

This is not helpful.

I need to find a sequence where the net movement is towards bank2 while maintaining the constraints.

This is really tricky.

Maybe I need to consider that the only safe way is to always have at least one missionary present wherever there are cannibals, on both banks and in the boat.

Given that, perhaps sending one missionary and one cannibal across is the only safe move, but as we've seen, it leads to problems when someone returns.

Alternatively, perhaps sending two missionaries across is necessary at some point, accepting that it leads to a temporary violation on bank1, but finding a way to fix it in subsequent moves.

But so far, I haven't found a sequence that works without violating the constraints.

Maybe I need to think about the problem differently, perhaps considering the boat's movements and the people it carries in a more detailed way.

Let me try to list all possible legal moves from the starting state.

Starting state:

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Possible moves:

1. Send one missionary across.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

But then, to bring the boat back, someone needs to return.

If a missionary returns:

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

No progress.

If a cannibal returns:

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

But bank2 has 0 missionaries and 1 cannibal, which violates the constraint.

2. Send one cannibal across.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, have the cannibal return.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

No progress.

3. Send two missionaries across.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, have one missionary return.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

But on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

4. Send two cannibals across.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, have one cannibal return.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Now, send two missionaries across.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

But on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

5. Send one missionary and one cannibal across.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, have the cannibal return.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Now, send two cannibals across.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

Then, have one cannibal return.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Now, send two missionaries across.

- Bank1: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

But on bank1, there are 0 missionaries and 2 cannibals, which violates the constraint.

This is not acceptable.

I'm starting to think that this problem might not have a solution given the constraints, or that I'm missing something crucial.

Alternatively, perhaps the boat's leaking condition and the need to bail water is a hint that only one person can be rowing at a time, but I'm not sure how that fits into the constraints.

Wait, the problem says, "A single person cannot row and bail simultaneously." But if there are two people in the boat, perhaps one can row while the other bails. But since the boat leaks only when there are two people in it, maybe that's manageable.

However, I don't think that directly affects the missionaries and cannibals constraints, so perhaps I should set that aspect aside for now.

Let me try to look up the standard solution to the missionaries and cannibals problem and see how it applies here.

In the standard problem, a solution is:

1. Send one missionary and one cannibal across.

2. Have the cannibal return.

3. Send two missionaries across.

4. Have one missionary return.

5. Send two cannibals across.

6. Have one cannibal return.

7. Send two missionaries across.

But as we've seen, this leads to states where cannibals outnumber missionaries on one of the banks, which is not allowed in this problem.

Alternatively, another solution is:

1. Send two cannibals across.

2. Have one cannibal return.

3. Send two missionaries across.

4. Have one missionary and one cannibal return.

5. Send two cannibals across.

6. Have one cannibal return.

7. Send two missionaries across.

Again, this leads to states where cannibals outnumber missionaries on bank1.

It seems like no matter what I do, I can't avoid having a state where cannibals outnumber missionaries on one of the banks.

Is there a way to modify the standard solution to account for this?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for temporary violations as long as the final state is safe, but the problem seems to imply that the constraints must be satisfied at all times.

Given that, perhaps this problem has no solution.

But I recall that in some variations of the missionaries and cannibals problem, with different constraints, there is no solution.

Perhaps this is one of those cases.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the boat can carry only one person sometimes, and two people at other times, to manage the constraints better.

Let me try a different sequence:

1. Send one cannibal across.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

2. Bring the cannibal back.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

No progress.

3. Send two missionaries across.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

4. Have one missionary return.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

But on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

This seems unavoidable.

Alternatively, perhaps sending two cannibals across and managing the returns differently.

1. Send two cannibals across.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

2. Send one cannibal back.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank1, empty

3. Send two missionaries across.

- Bank1: 1 missionary, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 2 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

But again, on bank1, cannibals outnumber missionaries.

This is frustrating. Maybe there's no solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for more flexibility in the boat's capacity or the constraints, but based on the problem statement, it seems these constraints are strictly enforced.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the boat can carry only one person in some trips to manage the constraints better.

Let me try:

1. Send one cannibal across.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 2 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 1 cannibal

- Boat: at bank2, empty

2. Bring the cannibal back.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

No progress.

Alternatively:

1. Send one missionary across.

- Bank1: 2 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 1 missionary, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank2, empty

2. Bring the missionary back.

- Bank1: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals

- Bank2: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals

- Boat: at bank1, empty

Again, no progress.

This seems hopeless.

Wait, maybe I need to accept that some constraints will be violated temporarily, as long as the final state is safe, but the problem likely requires that constraints are satisfied at all times.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a four-person variant or some other twist, but in this case, it's specifically three missionaries and three cannibals.

I think I need to conclude that, given the constraints, it's impossible to get all missionaries and cannibals safely to bank2 without violating the conditions at some point.

But I'm not entirely sure, as I might be missing a creative solution.

Alternatively, perhaps involving more complex sequences of moves could resolve this, but given the time I've spent on this, I think it's safe to say that no solution exists under these constraints.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{No solution exists under the given constraints.}} \]
