Here's a solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, considering the added complexity of bailing:

Initial State:

Bank 1: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat
Bank 2: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
Moves (M = Missionary, C = Cannibal):

Move 1: Two Cannibals cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2. (2C)

Bank 1: 3M, 1C
Bank 2: 0M, 2C, Boat
Bailing Required
Move 2: One Cannibal returns from Bank 2 to Bank 1. (1C)

Bank 1: 3M, 2C, Boat
Bank 2: 0M, 1C
Bailing Not Required
Move 3: Two Cannibals cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2. (2C)

Bank 1: 3M, 0C
Bank 2: 0M, 3C, Boat
Bailing Required
Move 4: One Cannibal returns from Bank 2 to Bank 1. (1C)

Bank 1: 3M, 1C, Boat
Bank 2: 0M, 2C
Bailing Not Required
Move 5: Two Missionaries cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2. (2M)

Bank 1: 1M, 1C
Bank 2: 2M, 2C, Boat
Bailing Required
Move 6: One Missionary and One Cannibal return from Bank 2 to Bank 1. (1M, 1C)

Bank 1: 2M, 2C, Boat
Bank 2: 1M, 1C
Bailing Required
Move 7: Two Missionaries cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2. (2M)

Bank 1: 0M, 2C
Bank 2: 3M, 1C, Boat
Bailing Required
Move 8: One Cannibal returns from Bank 2 to Bank 1. (1C)

Bank 1: 0M, 3C, Boat
Bank 2: 3M, 0C
Bailing Not Required
Move 9: Two Cannibals cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2. (2C)

Bank 1: 0M, 1C
Bank 2: 3M, 2C, Boat
Bailing Required
Move 10: One Cannibal returns from Bank 2 to Bank 1. (1C)

Bank 1: 0M, 2C, Boat
Bank 2: 3M, 1C
Bailing Not Required
Move 11: The final two Cannibals cross from Bank 1 to Bank 2. (2C)

Bank 1: 0M, 0C
Bank 2: 3M, 3C, Boat
Bailing Required
Final State:

Bank 1: 0 Missionaries, 0 Cannibals
Bank 2: 3 Missionaries, 3 Cannibals, Boat
This solution ensures that at no point do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank or in the boat, and it explicitly notes when bailing is required.
