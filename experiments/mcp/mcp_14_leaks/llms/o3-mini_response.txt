Thought about missionaries and cannibals puzzle for 26 seconds
Evaluating the puzzle

I’m analyzing the puzzle with three missionaries and three cannibals, ensuring the boat is bailed if it contains two people, and preventing cannibals from outnumbering missionaries on either side or in the boat.

Mapping the plan

I'm figuring out how to manage the boat's movements with water bailed, ensuring the cannibals never outnumber the missionaries on the boat and minimizing movements to optimize the plan.

Addressing ambiguity

I'm noting the ambiguity of the constraint as applied only when missionaries are present, ensuring cannibals never outnumber missionaries on the boat or shore to prevent missionaries from being eaten.

Designating roles

Assigning roles is crucial: one person rows while the other bails, given the boat's leakage and two-person limit. This ensures efficient collaboration and addresses the constraint effectively.

Mapping out the sequence

I’m noting the sequence of moves for missionaries and cannibals with a boat capacity of 2, factoring in the water bailing constraint. Each move set involves one person rowing and the other bailing.

Revising the plan

OK, let me see. I'm adjusting the solution to accommodate the water bailing constraint and the ambiguity surrounding missionaries and cannibals on the boat, aiming for a viable sequence.

Mapping out the plan

I’m adapting the steps to incorporate water bailing, ensuring that the boat's movement with two cannibals and no missionaries aligns with the cannibal-not-outnumbering-missionaries rule.

Sketching the plan

I’m working on a sequence of moves with water bailing. Ensuring two cannibals crossing together while adhering to the cannibal-missionary balance when no missionaries are present.

Navigating constraints

I'm detailing the sequence of canoe movements, balancing cannibals and missionaries, and ensuring water bailing is integrated, while the cannibal-missionary ratio is maintained without violating the rules.

Ensuring safe movements

I’m verifying each step to maintain a safe balance of cannibals and missionaries, incorporating water bailing, and confirming the boat's sequence without breaching rules.

Adjusting the approach

Balancing personnel to prevent rule breaches, contemplating water bailing, and personal constraints. Rowing 1 missionary seems optimal for a safe return journey.

Balancing the movements

Optimizing the journey by ensuring the boat is evenly loaded and adhering to the rules, with water bailing deemed acceptable and one return journey allowed.

Ensuring safe returns

I’m thinking through the return journey by reversing the previous move, balancing the boat's load, and guaranteeing a safe environment for both cannibals and missionaries.

Evaluating the move

Sending two cannibals results in a safe state. No missionaries are in danger, and the boat reaches the second bank with all personnel successfully transported.

Moving towards the goal

Sending 2 cannibals to the right before returning one ensures the boat is balanced, progressing steadily towards the goal of transferring everyone to the second bank.

Ensuring safety

I’m making sure that each transfer maintains safety by evaluating personnel load on both banks. The final balanced state confirms all personnel are safely transported to the second bank.

Evaluating boat dynamics

I'm thinking through the boat safety constraints, ensuring cannibals never outnumber missionaries, even with zero missionaries. The rules are checked to maintain a secure setting throughout.

Evaluating constraints

The rule is clear: cannibals must never outnumber missionaries. With no missionaries, cannibals don't outnumber anyone. Ensuring safety and balance throughout the transport.

Ensuring role clarity

OK, let me see. Assigning specific roles to each crossing ensures the water-bailing requirement is met, maintaining balance and safety throughout the journey.

Safely balancing roles

Ensuring the boat's weight is evenly distributed prevents tipping. With no excess weight, safety is maintained. This methodically secures each crossing, keeping the plan intact.

Balancing movements

I’m thinking through the sequence of cannibals and missionaries to keep the boat weight balanced. Ensuring careful planning and coordination throughout each step is paramount.

Tracking movements

I’m recalculating the boat's weight dynamics after each move, ensuring all constraints are met. This helps maintain careful balance throughout the journey. Progress is steady and methodical.

Balancing the journey

Ensuring the boat's weight remains balanced is crucial for safe transport. Precision in managing cannibals, missionaries, and water bailing is key to maintaining equilibrium.

Balancing the boat

I’m recalculating the weights each time to ensure the boat stays balanced. This involves meticulously managing the movements of cannibals, missionaries, and bailing water.

Adjusting my calculations

Revisiting each weight balance after each movement ensures the boat stays level. Twisting my method to include precise cannibal and missionary adjustments.

Managing movements

I’m starting with cannibals and missionaries on the left bank, ensuring equilibrium as the boat returns and forth, keeping the journey safe and balanced.

Four trips, sturdy balance

Mapping out four boat trips with cannibals from bank1 to bank2. Each time, one cannibal returns, ensuring both banks stay balanced and the journey remains safe.

We can “draw‐out” a solution by describing a sequence of moves. In our notation the state is written as

  (M_left, C_left ; boat_location ; M_right, C_right)

with the initial state

  (3, 3 ; bank1 ; 0, 0)

and the goal state

  (0, 0 ; bank2 ; 3, 3)

Recall the extra “leak” twist: whenever the boat carries two people it “leaks” so that one of its occupants must spend the trip bailing water while the other rows. (A single person in the boat is fully occupied with rowing.) In every move that loads the boat with two people you must think of the two roles as split between the two passengers. (Also note that on the boat the rule “cannibals may not outnumber missionaries” is interpreted just as on a bank – if no missionaries are present on board, there is no danger.)

Below is one correct 11‐move plan. (Any move that “loads two people” is understood to require that one person rows while the other bails water.) Each move is described by who is in the boat and from which bank to which bank the boat travels.

Step–by–Step Plan
Move 1:
  From bank1 send two cannibals across.
  Boat load: (C, C) (roles: one rows, one bails water)
  State becomes: (3, 3 – 2 = 3,1 ; bank2 ; 0, 0+2 = 0,2)
  That is, (3, 1 ; bank2 ; 0, 2).
  (Both banks are safe: bank1 has 3 ≥ 1, and bank2 has no missionaries so no danger.)

Move 2:
  From bank2 send one cannibal back.
  Boat load: (C) (no leak since one person can row without bailing)
  State becomes:
  Left: (3, 1+1 = 3,2); Right: (0,2–1 = 0,1); Boat at bank1.
  That is, (3, 2 ; bank1 ; 0, 1).

Move 3:
  From bank1 send two cannibals across.
  Boat load: (C, C) (one rows, one bails)
  State becomes:
  Left: (3, 2–2 = 3,0); Right: (0, 1+2 = 0,3); Boat at bank2.
  That is, (3, 0 ; bank2 ; 0, 3).

Move 4:
  From bank2 send one cannibal back.
  Boat load: (C)
  State becomes:
  Left: (3, 0+1 = 3,1); Right: (0, 3–1 = 0,2); Boat at bank1.
  That is, (3, 1 ; bank1 ; 0, 2).

Move 5:
  From bank1 send two missionaries across.
  Boat load: (M, M) (one rows, one bails)
  State becomes:
  Left: (3–2 = 1, 1); Right: (0+2 = 2, 2); Boat at bank2.
  That is, (1, 1 ; bank2 ; 2, 2).
  (Check: bank1 has 1M,1C (equal numbers) and bank2 has 2M,2C (also safe).)

Move 6:
  From bank2 send one missionary and one cannibal back.
  Boat load: (M, C) (two people so one must bail while the other rows
   – and note that on board there is 1 missionary and 1 cannibal (equal numbers))
  State becomes:
  Left: (1+1 = 2, 1+1 = 2); Right: (2–1 = 1, 2–1 = 1); Boat at bank1.
  That is, (2, 2 ; bank1 ; 1, 1).

Move 7:
  From bank1 send two missionaries across.
  Boat load: (M, M) (one rows, one bails)
  State becomes:
  Left: (2–2 = 0, 2 remains → 0,2); Right: (1+2 = 3, 1 remains → 3,1); Boat at bank2.
  That is, (0, 2 ; bank2 ; 3, 1).

Move 8:
  From bank2 send one cannibal back.
  Boat load: (C)
  State becomes:
  Left: (0, 2+1 = 0,3); Right: (3, 1–1 = 3,0); Boat at bank1.
  That is, (0, 3 ; bank1 ; 3, 0).

Move 9:
  From bank1 send two cannibals across.
  Boat load: (C, C) (one rows, one bails)
  State becomes:
  Left: (0, 3–2 = 0,1); Right: (3, 0+2 = 3,2); Boat at bank2.
  That is, (0, 1 ; bank2 ; 3, 2).

Move 10:
  From bank2 send one cannibal back.
  Boat load: (C)
  State becomes:
  Left: (0, 1+1 = 0,2); Right: (3, 2–1 = 3,1); Boat at bank1.
  That is, (0, 2 ; bank1 ; 3, 1).

Move 11:
  From bank1 send two cannibals across.
  Boat load: (C, C) (one rows, one bails)
  State becomes:
  Left: (0, 2–2 = 0,0); Right: (3, 1+2 = 3,3); Boat at bank2.
  That is, (0, 0 ; bank2 ; 3, 3) – the goal state.

Summary of the Moves
bank1 → bank2: (C, C)
bank2 → bank1: (C)
bank1 → bank2: (C, C)
bank2 → bank1: (C)
bank1 → bank2: (M, M)
bank2 → bank1: (M, C)
bank1 → bank2: (M, M)
bank2 → bank1: (C)
bank1 → bank2: (C, C)
bank2 → bank1: (C)
bank1 → bank2: (C, C)
In every two‐person crossing the “leak” is handled by having one person bail water while the other rows—and in the one–person trips no bailing is needed.

This 11–move plan gets all three missionaries and all three cannibals safely from bank1 to bank2 without ever allowing the cannibals to outnumber the missionaries (whether on a bank or in the boat).

Final Answer
The above sequence is a valid plan to solve the problem.
