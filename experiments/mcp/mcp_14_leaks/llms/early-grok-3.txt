This problem is a variation of the classic "Missionaries and Cannibals" puzzle, with additional constraints such as the boat's capacity, the need for bailing water when two people are in the boat, and the restriction that a single person cannot row and bail simultaneously. Let's solve this step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Entities**:
   - **Vessel**: The boat (capacity = 2).
   - **Locations**: `bank1` (starting side) and `bank2` (destination side).
   - **Groups**: Missionaries (M) and Cannibals (C).
   - **Integers**: Used to track the number of missionaries and cannibals at each location and in the boat (e.g., 0 to 6).

2. **Initial State**:
   - At `bank1`: 3 missionaries (M), 3 cannibals (C), and the boat.
   - At `bank2`: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals.

3. **Goal State**:
   - At `bank2`: 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals, and the boat.
   - At `bank1`: 0 missionaries, 0 cannibals.

4. **Constraints**:
   - The boat can carry at most 2 people at once.
   - The boat cannot cross the river empty.
   - Cannibals must not outnumber missionaries on either bank, or the missionaries will be eaten.
   - Cannibals must not outnumber missionaries in the boat, or the missionaries will be eaten.
   - If there are 2 people in the boat, water must be bailed while crossing, and a single person cannot row and bail simultaneously (i.e., 2 people are required for a 2-person crossing).

5. **State Representation**:
   - We represent the state as `(M1, C1, B, M2, C2)`, where:
     - `M1`: Number of missionaries on `bank1`.
     - `C1`: Number of cannibals on `bank1`.
     - `B`: Location of the boat (`1` for `bank1`, `2` for `bank2`).
     - `M2`: Number of missionaries on `bank2`.
     - `C2`: Number of cannibals on `bank2`.

6. **Initial State**: `(3, 3, 1, 0, 0)` (all on `bank1`, boat on `bank1`).
7. **Goal State**: `(0, 0, 2, 3, 3)` (all on `bank2`, boat on `bank2`).

### Constraints in Detail:
1. **Cannibal-Missionary Safety on Banks**:
   - On `bank1`: If `M1 > 0`, then `C1 ≤ M1`.
   - On `bank2`: If `M2 > 0`, then `C2 ≤ M2`.

2. **Cannibal-Missionary Safety in Boat**:
   - If `Mb > 0` (missionaries in the boat), then `Cb ≤ Mb` (cannibals in the boat).

3. **Boat Capacity and Bailing**:
   - The boat can carry 1 or 2 people.
   - If 2 people are in the boat, both are needed (one to row, one to bail).
   - The boat cannot cross empty.

---

### Solution:
We need to find a sequence of valid boat trips that moves all missionaries and cannibals from `bank1` to `bank2`, satisfying all constraints. Let's denote a boat trip as `(Mb, Cb, direction)`, where:
- `Mb`: Number of missionaries in the boat.
- `Cb`: Number of cannibals in the boat.
- `direction`: `1→2` (from `bank1` to `bank2`) or `2→1` (from `bank2` to `bank1`).

We will solve this by trial and error, ensuring all constraints are satisfied at each step.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Initial State**: `(3, 3, 1, 0, 0)` (boat on `bank1`).
   - On `bank1`: 3M, 3C.
