Actions:
cross(vessel)

Constants:
loc(vessel) - The location of the vessel (boat); remains the same unless changed, so it is an inertial fluent.
numOnBank(group, location) - The number of individuals of a group at a location; changes over time, so it is an inertial fluent.
numOnBoat(group) - The number of individuals of a group on the boat; changes over time, so it is an inertial fluent.
capacity(vessel) - The capacity of the vessel; remains the same unless changed, so it is an inertial fluent.
from(vessel) - The starting location for the crossing; an attribute of the cross action.
to(vessel) - The destination location for the crossing; an attribute of the cross action.
numOnBoard(vessel, group) - The number of individuals of a group on the boat during crossing; an attribute of the cross action.
