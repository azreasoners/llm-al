I've developed a Python program to solve the classic "Missionaries and Cannibals" problem. Here's a step-by-step solution:

(1, 1, 0): One missionary and one cannibal cross the river from bank1 to bank2.
(-1, 0, 1): One missionary returns alone to bank1.
(0, 2, 0): Two cannibals cross the river from bank1 to bank2.
(0, -1, 1): One cannibal returns to bank1.
(2, 0, 0): Two missionaries cross the river from bank1 to bank2.
(-1, -1, 1): One missionary and one cannibal return to bank1.
(2, 0, 0): Two missionaries cross the river from bank1 to bank2.
(0, -1, 1): One cannibal returns to bank1.
(0, 2, 0): Two cannibals cross the river from bank1 to bank2.
(0, -1, 1): One cannibal returns to bank1.
(0, 2, 0): Two cannibals cross the river from bank1 to bank2 for the last time.
In this solution, no missionaries are outnumbered by cannibals at any point, and the movement restrictions regarding boat capacity and the necessity of bailing water when the boat is fully loaded are respected. â€‹
