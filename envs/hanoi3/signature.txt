There are three types of things: "loc", "disk", and "peg".
"loc" includes "disk".
"loc" includes "peg".

a,b, and c are pegs.
d1, d2, and d2 are disks. 

Fluents
The (disk)'s location is an inertial fluent (loc).
A (disk) being heavier than another (disk) is an inertial fluent (boolean).

Actions
Moving a (disk) to a (loc) is an action.
