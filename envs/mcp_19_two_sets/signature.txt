The number of a (set)'s (group) at a (location) is an additive fluent (integer).
The capacity of a (set)'s (vessel) ranges from 1..2.

Actions
Crossing a (set)'s (vessel) is an action.
A (set)'s (vessel) going is an attribute (location) of the crossing action.
The amount of members on a (set)'s (vessel) of a (group) is an attribute (integer) of the crossing action.
