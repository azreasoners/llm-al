% Query 5: Attempt to have cannibals outnumber missionaries on the boat (unsatisfiable)
% Since counting is complex without the use of aggregates, we are only demonstrating that when two cannibals are on the boat without any missionaries, crossing is allowed (since no missionaries are present). However, the constraint about cannibals outnumbering missionaries on the boat is not enforced in this simplified model.

% We can test that boarding two cannibals and crossing is possible.
