Actions:
- cross(vessel)

Constants:
- loc(vessel): The location of a vessel (boat), an inertial fluent.
- numAt(group, location): The number of group members at a particular location, an additive fluent.
- capacity(vessel): The capacity of a vessel, an inertial fluent.
- transporting(vessel, group): The number of group members being transported during the crossing action, an attribute of `cross(vessel)`.
