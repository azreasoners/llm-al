% Generated constraints

% 1. Crossing the river in a vessel causes the location of the vessel to change to movingTo(Vessel).
cross(V) causes loc(V) = Loc if movingTo(V) = Loc.

% 2. Crossing the river in a vessel causes the number of people of each group at the starting location to decrease by numMoving(Vessel, Group).
cross(V) decrements numOn(Loc, G) by N if loc(V) = Loc & numMoving(V, G) = N.

% 3. Crossing the river in a vessel causes the number of people of each group at the movingTo location to increase by numMoving(Vessel, Group).
cross(V) increments numOn(Loc, G) by N if movingTo(V) = Loc & numMoving(V, G) = N.

% 4. The cross action is not executable if the sum of numMoving(Vessel, missionaries) and numMoving(Vessel, cannibals) is zero.
nonexecutable cross(V) if N1 + N2 = 0 & numMoving(V, missionaries) = N1 & numMoving(V, cannibals) = N2.

% 5. The cross action is not executable if the sum of numMoving(Vessel, missionaries) and numMoving(Vessel, cannibals) is greater than two.
nonexecutable cross(V) if N1 + N2 > 2 & numMoving(V, missionaries) = N1 & numMoving(V, cannibals) = N2.

% 6. The cross action is not executable if numMoving(Vessel, Group) is negative for any group.
nonexecutable cross(V) if N < 0 & numMoving(V, G) = N.

% 7. The cross action is not executable if numMoving(Vessel, Group) exceeds the number of people of that group at the current location of the vessel.
nonexecutable cross(V) if M > N & numMoving(V, G) = M & loc(V) = Loc & numOn(Loc, G) = N.

% 8. The cross action is not executable if movingTo(Vessel) is the same as the current location of the vessel.
nonexecutable cross(V) if loc(V) = Loc & movingTo(V) = Loc.

% 9. After the crossing, on either bank, if the number of missionaries is greater than zero, the number of cannibals cannot exceed the number of missionaries.
always (numOn(Loc, missionaries) = M & numOn(Loc, cannibals) = C & M > 0) -> C <= M.

% 10. During the crossing, if the number of missionaries moving is greater than zero, the number of cannibals moving cannot exceed the number of missionaries moving.
nonexecutable cross(V) if M > 0 & C > M & numMoving(V, missionaries) = M & numMoving(V, cannibals) = C.
