% The crossing action of a set causes the boat's location for that set to become the destination of the crossing action for that set.
% The crossing action of a set causes the number of people of each group at the destination location for that set to increase by the number of people of that group crossing in that set's boat.
% The crossing action of a set causes the number of people of each group at the origin location for that set to decrease by the number of people of that group crossing in that set's boat.
% The origin location of the crossing action for a set is the boat's location for that set.
% The crossing action of a set is not executable if the boat's location for that set is equal to the destination location of the crossing action for that set.
% The crossing action of a set is not executable if the total number of people crossing in that set's boat is zero.
% The total number of people crossing in a set's boat cannot exceed 2.
% The crossing action of a set is not executable if the number of people of any group crossing in that set's boat is less than zero.
% The crossing action of a set is not executable if the number of people of any group crossing in that set's boat exceeds the number of people of that group at the origin location for that set.
% The crossing action of a set is not executable if the number of people of any group at any location for that set would become negative after the crossing.
% The number of people of any group at any location for a set cannot be negative.
% The crossing action of a set is not executable if, after the crossing, at any location for that set, the number of cannibals would exceed the number of missionaries, unless the number of missionaries at that location is zero.
% The crossing action of a set is not executable if the number of cannibals crossing in that set's boat exceeds the number of missionaries crossing in that set's boat, unless the number of missionaries crossing is zero.
% The total number of people of each group in a set is constant and equal to 3.
% The total number of people of any group at both locations for a set remains constant.
% The crossing action of one set does not affect the states or variables of the other set.
% The boat's location for one set does not affect the boat's location for another set.
% The number of people of any group at any location for one set does not affect the number of people of any group at any location for another set.
% The sets are independent and do not interact with each other.
